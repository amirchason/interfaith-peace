## Overview

One of the most significant verses in the Quran regarding peace and warfare is found in Surah Al-Anfal (The Spoils of War). Despite the chapter's focus on rules of engagement during conflict, it contains a powerful command to prioritize peace when the opportunity arises.

This teaching demonstrates a core principle in Islam: **peace is the default state, and warfare is only permissible under strict conditions and must end as soon as enemies seek reconciliation**.

## Sacred Text

### Original Arabic

**وَإِن جَنَحُوا۟ لِلسَّلْمِ فَٱجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ**

*Wa in janahū lil-salmi fajnah lahā wa tawakkal 'alā Allāh, innahu huwa as-samī'u al-'alīm*

### Translation (Saheeh International)

> **And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.**
>
> — Quran 8:61

### Alternative Translations

**Muhammad Asad:**
> "But if they incline to peace, incline thou to it as well, and place thy trust in God: verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing!"

**Yusuf Ali:**
> "But if the enemy inclines towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in Allah: for He is One that heareth and knoweth (all things)."

## Meaning & Interpretation

### For Beginners

**What does this verse mean?**

This verse gives a clear command: **when your enemies want peace, you must accept it**. There's no option to continue fighting if the other side genuinely seeks to end the conflict.

The verse uses the word "janaha" (to incline, to lean towards), which suggests:
- A sincere movement toward peace
- Not just a tactical pause, but genuine reconciliation
- Both sides "leaning in" to peace together

**Why is this important?**

This teaching shows that in Islam:
- Peace is always preferred over war
- Muslims must respond positively to genuine peace offers
- Continuing to fight when peace is available is against God's command
- Trust in Allah allows believers to take the "risk" of peace

### Historical Context

**The Revelation Context**

Surah Al-Anfal was revealed after the Battle of Badr (624 CE), the first major military engagement between the early Muslim community in Medina and the Quraysh of Mecca. The chapter addresses:
- Rules of engagement in warfare
- Treatment of prisoners
- Distribution of war spoils
- **Most importantly: when to end fighting**

**The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE)**

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) demonstrated this principle dramatically two years later. He agreed to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah with the Quraysh, even though:
- Many companions thought the terms favored the enemy
- Muslims had to accept conditions they found difficult
- They had to return to Medina without performing pilgrimage

The Quran later called this apparent setback a "clear victory" (Quran 48:1) because it brought ten years of peace during which Islam flourished. This shows that **peace itself can be a greater victory than military triumph**.

### Classical Scholarly Commentary

**Ibn Kathir (14th century)** wrote in his tafsir:

> "If the disbelievers incline towards making peace with you, then you should incline towards it too and accept their offer... Some scholars said this verse was abrogated by the verse of the sword, but the correct view is that it is not abrogated. Rather, Muslims should accept peace offers when it serves the interest of Muslims."

**Al-Qurtubi (13th century)** explained:

> "This verse establishes that if the enemy offers peace, whether truly or deceitfully, the Muslims must accept outwardly while maintaining vigilance. The command uses 'fajnah lahā' (incline to it), which is an emphatic imperative, meaning peace must be accepted without hesitation when offered."

**Modern Scholar Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl** writes:

> "The Quranic ethic is one that presumes peace and considers war exceptional. Verse 8:61 is not merely permission to accept peace—it is a commandment. When the enemy seeks reconciliation, Muslims are obligated to respond in kind. This reflects the Islamic principle that the preservation of human life takes precedence over the continuation of conflict."

### Advanced Analysis

**Jurisprudential (Fiqh) Implications**

Islamic scholars have debated several aspects of this verse:

1. **Who can offer peace?**
   - Majority view: Any legitimate authority representing the enemy
   - Peace can be temporary (hudna) or permanent (mu'ahada)

2. **Conditions for acceptance**:
   - Peace must not violate fundamental Islamic principles
   - It must serve the welfare (maslaha) of the Muslim community
   - Even unfavorable terms may be accepted if peace serves a greater good

3. **Relationship to "fighting verses"**:
   - Some scholars claimed later verses "abrogated" this one
   - Modern consensus: All verses must be read in context
   - This verse remains operative and essential to Islamic ethics

**The Word "Salm" (Peace)**

The Arabic word used here, *salm* (سَلْم), is related to:
- *Salām* (سَلَام) - peace, the Islamic greeting
- *Silm* (سِلْم) - peace treaty, state of peace
- *Islām* (إِسْلَام) - submission to God, the religion itself

This linguistic connection suggests that **peace is integral to the very meaning of Islam**. The religion's name itself comes from the same root as "peace."

**"Rely upon Allah"**

The verse ends with "rely upon Allah" (*tawakkal 'alā Allāh*), addressing a psychological reality: accepting peace requires trust that:
- God will protect believers even without military advantage
- Peace is not weakness but strength grounded in faith
- Divine wisdom sees what human calculation cannot

## Parallel Teachings Across Faiths

| Religion | Teaching | Similarity | Application |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Christianity** | "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9) | Both make peacemaking a religious duty | Jesus calls peacemakers "children of God"; Quran calls Muslims to embody salām |
| **Buddhism** | "Hatred never ceases by hatred, but by love alone" (Dhammapada 1:5) | Both teach ending cycles of retaliation | Buddha emphasizes inner transformation; Quran emphasizes outward action |
| **Hinduism** | Ahimsa (non-violence) principle | Both seek to minimize harm | Ahimsa is comprehensive non-harm; Islam permits self-defense but mandates peace when possible |
| **Judaism** | "Seek peace and pursue it" (Psalm 34:14) | Both make peace an active pursuit | Psalmist emphasizes constant seeking; Quran emphasizes responsive acceptance |

## Modern Application

### Historical Examples

**Camp David Accords (1978)**
When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat sought peace with Israel, many Muslim scholars cited Quran 8:61 to support the unprecedented peace treaty, even though it was controversial in the Arab world.

**Good Friday Agreement (1998)**
Muslim mediators helped broker peace in Northern Ireland, drawing on Islamic principles of reconciliation and citing this verse as justification for compromise.

**Mindanao Peace Process (2014)**
The Bangsamoro peace agreement between the Philippine government and Muslim groups was framed using Islamic peace teachings, including this verse.

### Personal Practice

**In Daily Conflicts:**
- When someone who wronged you seeks to make amends, accept genuinely
- Don't hold grudges even if you "won" the argument
- Be the first to extend a hand of reconciliation
- Trust that making peace is stronger than proving you're right

**In Community:**
- Mediate disputes between family members or friends
- Don't perpetuate feuds or take sides indefinitely
- Model forgiveness and reconciliation
- Create opportunities for healing conversations

### Contemporary Peacebuilding

**Interfaith Initiatives:**
Modern Muslim scholars and activists apply this verse to:
- Interfaith dialogue and cooperation
- Conflict resolution in multi-religious societies
- Responding to Islamophobia with education rather than anger
- Building coalitions across faith lines for justice

**Conflict Zones:**
Organizations like Islamic Relief and Muslim peacebuilders in conflict zones cite this verse when:
- Facilitating peace negotiations
- Mediating tribal or sectarian conflicts
- Promoting reconciliation after violence
- Teaching nonviolent resistance

## Reflection Questions

**For Personal Reflection:**
1. Who in my life has "inclined to peace" that I have not reciprocated?
2. What fears prevent me from accepting peace offers?
3. How can I develop the trust in God that allows me to risk peace?
4. Where am I holding onto conflict when reconciliation is possible?

**For Group Discussion:**
1. Why does the Quran command acceptance of peace rather than just permitting it?
2. How does this teaching challenge stereotypes about Islam and violence?
3. What does "rely upon Allah" mean in the context of making peace?
4. How can Muslim communities better embody this principle in the modern world?
