## Overview

**"Seek peace and pursue it"** (בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ / *Bakeish shalom v'radfehu*) - These five Hebrew words from Psalm 34 contain one of Judaism's most foundational commands about peace.

The verse is remarkable for its **double imperative**:
1. **Seek it** (bakesh) - Search for peace where you are
2. **Pursue it** (radfeihu) - Chase after peace even beyond your location

The Hebrew word **radaf** (רדף) typically means "chase," "hunt," or "pursue intensely"—the same word used for pursuing an enemy! The Psalmist says: **Put that same intensity into pursuing peace.**

This teaching has shaped Jewish ethics for millennia, establishing that **peace is not a passive hope but an active obligation**—a lifelong quest requiring energy, creativity, and courage.

## Meaning & Interpretation

### For Beginners

**What does "seek peace and pursue it" mean?**

This verse teaches that peace requires **two levels of effort**:

**1. Seek Peace (Bakeish Shalom)**

Hebrew **bakesh** (בקש) = seek, search, inquire

**Meaning:**
- Look for opportunities for peace in your immediate sphere
- Be attentive to chances for reconciliation
- Create peace where you currently are
- **Active searching**, not passive waiting

**Example:**
- Notice when friends are fighting → offer to mediate
- See tension at work → facilitate dialogue
- Family conflict brewing → intervene early

**2. Pursue It (Radfehu)**

Hebrew **radaf** (רדף) = chase, pursue intensely, hunt

**This is the radical part:**
- Don't just seek peace where you are
- **Go beyond your location** to make peace
- Chase peace with the same intensity you'd flee an enemy
- Travel if needed, sacrifice if necessary

**Example:**
- Friend moves away angry → you travel to reconcile
- Community conflict → actively work to heal it even if inconvenient
- Peace possible elsewhere → extend your efforts beyond comfort zone

**Why two verbs?**

Rabbi Avraham Twersky explains:

> "Other mitzvot (commandments) you perform when the opportunity arises. But peace is so precious that you must seek it out—and if it's not in your place, pursue it elsewhere. No other commandment demands this dual active effort."

**What is "Shalom"?**

**Shalom** (שלום) means far more than "peace" as absence of conflict:
- **Wholeness** (from root sh-l-m, "complete")
- **Harmony** in relationships
- **Well-being** (physical, emotional, spiritual)
- **Justice** (peace with righteousness)
- **Prosperity** (collective flourishing)

**Biblical shalom** is God's vision for all creation living in right relationship.

### Historical Context

**Psalm 34's Authorship**

Traditional attribution: **King David**, written when fleeing King Saul's persecution

The psalm's superscription says:

> "Of David, when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he left."

Context: David, anointed future king, is hunted by current king Saul. David seeks refuge with Philistine king Achish (called Abimelech in the psalm).

**Irony**: David writes "seek peace and pursue it" while he himself is pursued by enemies!

**Teaching:** Even when peace seems impossible, you must actively work for it.

**Place in Jewish Liturgy**

This verse appears repeatedly in Jewish prayer and practice:

1. **Grace After Meals** (Birkat Hamazon) - Psalm 34 is sung on weekdays
2. **Kabbalat Shabbat** (Welcoming Sabbath) - Celebrates arrival of shalom (peace/Sabbath)
3. **Funeral Services** - Reminder to pursue peace even in grief
4. **Bar/Bat Mitzvah** - Often cited in speeches about entering adulthood

**Rabbinic Amplification**

The rabbis of the Talmud elevated this verse to extraordinary status:

**Leviticus Rabbah 9:9:**

> "Great is peace, for all blessings are included in it... Great is peace, for concerning all other commandments it says, 'If you encounter...' (conditional). But concerning peace it says, 'Seek peace' (proactive)—seek it in your place and pursue it elsewhere."

**Hillel the Elder** (1st century BCE) said:

> "Be of the disciples of Aaron: Love peace and pursue peace, love people and bring them close to Torah."

**Notice:** Hillel uses the same verb **"pursue"** (rodef) - making peace-pursuit a defining characteristic of Aaron (Moses's brother), who was famous for reconciling disputants.

### Classical Scholarly Commentary

**Rashi (11th century France):**

> "'Seek peace' means seek peace for yourself and your household. 'And pursue it' means pursue peace for others, even those far from you. Go out of your way to establish peace between people."

**Radak (Rabbi David Kimchi, 12th-13th century):**

> "A person might think, 'It's enough if I don't cause conflict.' But the verse says you must actively create peace. And not just when it's easy—'pursue it' means even when it requires effort, travel, or sacrifice."

**Malbim (19th century):**

> "Shalom has two dimensions: (1) Internal harmony (seek—work on yourself) (2) External relationships (pursue—work with others). Both are necessary for true peace."

### Modern Scholarly Analysis

**Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks z"l (1948-2020):**

> "Peace is not a passive state but an active achievement. It must be fought for—not with weapons but with words, not with violence but with the vulnerability of reaching out across divides. 'Seek and pursue' tells us peace will not come to you; you must go to it."

> "Judaism is counter-intuitive. We think peace means no conflict. Judaism says peace means engaging conflict constructively—not avoiding but transforming it."

**Rabbi Rachel Mikva (contemporary):**

> "For too long, peace-making was seen as women's emotional labor while men made war. This verse shatters that: Peace-making is commanded of all. It requires courage, strategy, persistence—traits often gendered masculine—but directed toward shalom, not victory."

### Advanced Analysis

**The Grammar of Pursuit**

**Radaf (רדף)** appears 143 times in the Hebrew Bible, usually meaning:
- Pursue an enemy (Genesis 14:14)
- Chase prey (1 Samuel 23:25)
- Follow persistently (Hosea 8:3)

**Only THREE times** does it refer to pursuing abstract virtues:
1. **Peace** (Psalm 34:15)
2. **Righteousness** (Deuteronomy 16:20: "Justice, justice shall you pursue")
3. **Mercy and kindness** (Proverbs 21:21)

**Linguistic insight:** Peace requires the same intensity and determination as warfare—but directed toward reconciliation, not destruction.

**Peace in the Shema**

The Shema (Judaism's central prayer) ends with:

> "...that you may remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God."

Then the next paragraph begins:

> "True and firm, established and enduring...whose word is life eternal."

Commentators note: All mitzvot ultimately aim at bringing **shalom** (completion/wholeness) to creation. "Seek and pursue peace" is the meta-mitzvah—the purpose behind all others.

**Rodef Shalom as Jewish Identity**

The phrase **"rodef shalom"** (רודף שלום) - "pursuer of peace" - became a Jewish title of honor:

- Abraham was a rodef shalom (Genesis Rabbah)
- Aaron was the ultimate rodef shalom (Pirkei Avot 1:12)
- Every Jew should aspire to be a rodef shalom (Avot d'Rabbi Natan)

**This shapes Jewish self-understanding:** We're not just people who like peace—we're people commanded to chase it down.

**Theological Foundation: Peace as Divine Attribute**

Judaism teaches that **shalom is one of God's names**:

> "Just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, is called 'Peace,' as it says, 'And he called Him: The LORD is Peace' (Judges 6:24), so too you must pursue peace." (Talmud, Derekh Eretz Zuta 10)

**Implication:** When you pursue peace, you imitate God (imitatio dei). You become Godlike.

## Parallel Teachings Across Faiths

| Religion | Teaching | Similarity | Key Difference |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Christianity** | "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9) | Both make peacemaking active, divinely commanded work | Christian emphasis on enemy love; Jewish on comprehensive shalom |
| **Islam** | "Make peace between believers" (Quran 49:9-10) | Both command intervention in others' conflicts | Islamic focus on ummah (community); Jewish on universal peace |
| **Buddhism** | Metta practice for all beings | Both extend peace effort universally | Buddhist inner cultivation; Jewish external action |
| **Hinduism** | Ahimsa as positive duty | Both make non-violence active pursuit | Hindu focus on non-harm; Jewish on creating wholeness |

## Modern Application

### Personal Peacemaking

**Seek Peace (In Your Sphere):**

**Family:**
- Be the first to apologize
- Mediate sibling conflicts
- Create Shabbat atmosphere (weekly reset to peace)
- Don't let grudges fester

**Work:**
- Facilitate colleague reconciliation
- Address tensions before they explode
- Build bridges across department silos
- Speak well of absent colleagues

**Community:**
- Volunteer for conflict resolution training
- Join or create peace circles
- Be known as the person who heals, not inflames

**Pursue Peace (Beyond Your Sphere):**

**When someone leaves angry:**
- Call, text, visit to reconcile
- Don't let geography end relationship
- "Pursue" means inconvenience yourself

**Community conflicts:**
- Even if not directly involved, offer mediation
- Use your influence for reconciliation
- Travel to peace conferences, interfaith events
- Support peace organizations financially

**Example: Abraham Joshua Heschel**

Rabbi Heschel (1907-1972) embodied "pursue peace":
- Marched with MLK in Selma (pursued racial peace)
- Protested Vietnam War (pursued international peace)
- Led Catholic-Jewish dialogue after Vatican II (pursued interfaith peace)
- Said: "I felt my legs were praying" when marching

**He pursued peace far beyond his rabbinical duties.**

### Community & Institutional Peacemaking

**Synagogue Conflicts (sadly common):**

Issues:
- Rabbi-board tensions
- Budget battles
- Ritual disputes
- Generational divides

**Rodef Shalom approach:**
1. Form peace committee (neutral respected members)
2. **Seek peace:** Create space for all voices
3. **Pursue peace:** Don't give up when first attempts fail
4. Use trained mediators if needed
5. Ground in shared values (not just compromise)

**Interfaith Work**

Modern Jews apply "seek and pursue" to interfaith peace:

**Jewish-Muslim Dialogue:**
- Shared Abrahamic heritage
- Common experience of religious minority status
- Joint social justice projects
- Protecting each other's institutions

**Jewish-Christian Relations:**
- Healing 2000 years of painful history
- Vatican II transformed Catholic-Jewish relations
- Ongoing Protestant dialogues
- Recognize Jesus as Jewish teacher (from Jewish perspective)

**Universal Human Rights:**
- Tikkun olam (repair the world) + Rodef shalom = Jewish human rights activism
- Disproportionate Jewish involvement in civil rights, refugee support, anti-war movements
- Not accident—commanded to pursue peace

### Historical Examples

**Rabbi Judah HaNasi (2nd-3rd century)**

After Roman destruction of Jerusalem, Rabbi Judah HaNasi (editor of Mishnah) built relationship with Roman Emperor Antoninus. Despite Roman oppression, he pursued peace for Jewish survival.

**Maimonides (Rambam, 12th century)**

Living in Muslim Spain/Egypt, Maimonides wrote extensively on peace:

> "The whole of the Torah is for the sake of peace, as it says, 'Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace' (Proverbs 3:17)."

**Modern State of Israel**

Israel's founders grappled with this verse:
- **Golda Meir:** "When peace comes we will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons."
- **Peace Now movement:** Cites "pursue peace" as mandate for territorial compromise

**Ongoing tension:** Security vs. peace pursuit in conflict zones.

## Reflection Questions

**For Personal Reflection:**

1. Where am I called to "seek" peace in my immediate sphere right now?
2. What relationship beyond my comfort zone needs me to "pursue" peace?
3. Do I invest as much energy in peace-making as in other goals?
4. What does "shalom" (wholeness) look like in my life?

**For Group Discussion:**

1. How do we balance "seeking peace" with standing for justice?
2. Can you pursue peace with those who don't want it?
3. What's the difference between pursuing peace and being a doormat?
4. How should Jewish communities apply this verse to Israel-Palestine?
