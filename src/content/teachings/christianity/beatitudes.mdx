## Overview

The Beatitudes stand as one of the most profound ethical teachings in human history. Delivered by Jesus at the beginning of his Sermon on the Mount, these statements radically redefine what it means to be "blessed" or "happy."

The fifth beatitude—"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God"—holds a place of honor among these teachings, positioning peacemaking not as passive avoidance of conflict, but as active participation in the divine work of reconciliation.

## Sacred Text

### Original Greek

**μακάριοι οἱ εἰρηνοποιοί, ὅτι αὐτοὶ υἱοὶ Θεοῦ κληθήσονται**

*makarioi hoi eirēnopoioi, hoti autoi huioi theou klēthēsontai*

### Translation (NRSV)

> **Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.**
>
> — Matthew 5:9

### Full Context (Matthew 5:1-12)

When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. And he began to speak and taught them, saying:

> **Blessed are the poor in spirit,** for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>
> **Blessed are those who mourn,** for they will be comforted.
>
> **Blessed are the meek,** for they will inherit the earth.
>
> **Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,** for they will be filled.
>
> **Blessed are the merciful,** for they will receive mercy.
>
> **Blessed are the pure in heart,** for they will see God.
>
> **Blessed are the peacemakers,** for they will be called children of God.
>
> **Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,** for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>
> Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.

## Meaning & Interpretation

### For Beginners

**What is a "peacemaker"?**

In Jesus's teaching, a peacemaker is not someone who simply avoids conflict or "keeps the peace" by staying quiet. Rather, a peacemaker is someone who **actively works to heal divisions** and bring reconciliation between people.

Think of it this way: When two friends are fighting, a peacemaker doesn't just say "stop fighting." Instead, they:
- Listen to both sides with compassion
- Help each person understand the other's perspective
- Work to find common ground
- Facilitate genuine reconciliation

**Why does this make someone a "child of God"?**

In the Bible, God is repeatedly described as the ultimate peacemaker—the one who reconciles humanity to himself and seeks to bring all creation into harmony. When we work for peace, we reflect God's own character and participate in his work in the world.

### Historical Context

**The Political Setting**

Jesus spoke these words around 30 CE during the Roman occupation of Judea. At this time, "peace" (*Pax Romana*) primarily meant submission to Roman imperial power—peace through military domination and threat of violence.

Jesus's teaching was **radically subversive**. He was redefining peace not as domination, but as:
- Active reconciliation
- Justice for the oppressed
- Healing of relationships
- Breaking cycles of violence

**The Jewish Context**

The Hebrew word for peace, *shalom*, means far more than absence of conflict. It encompasses:
- Wholeness
- Completeness
- Harmony in relationships
- Justice and righteousness
- Prosperity and well-being

When Jesus spoke of peacemakers, his Jewish audience would have understood this rich, holistic meaning of peace.

### Scholarly Commentary

**Dr. Amy-Jill Levine (Vanderbilt University)** writes:

> "To understand Jesus's teaching on peacemaking, we must first understand that he was a Jew speaking to Jews in the context of Roman occupation. The 'peacemakers' he blesses are not those who collaborate with oppressors, but those who work for true *shalom*—the biblical vision of justice, righteousness, and harmony that can only come when all people are treated with dignity."

**Dr. N.T. Wright (University of St Andrews)** explains:

> "The Beatitudes are not a list of virtues for individual piety, but a manifesto for the kingdom of God—a new way of being human. The peacemakers are those who anticipate and embody God's future, when 'nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore' (Isaiah 2:4)."

**Augustine of Hippo (5th century)** noted:

> "The peacemakers are blessed because they bear the likeness of God. For the Father gave peace to humanity through his Son, and the peacemaker, in maintaining peace among people, reflects this divine work."

### Advanced Analysis

**The Greek Word "Eirēnopoios"**

The word translated "peacemaker" (*eirēnopoios*) is rare in Greek literature. It combines:
- *eirēnē* (peace)
- *poieō* (to make, to do, to create)

This is not passive peacekeeping but **active peacemaking**—creating peace where it doesn't exist.

**Theological Implications**

1. **Participation in Divine Nature**: Only one other being in Scripture is called the ultimate peacemaker—God himself (Colossians 1:20). To be a peacemaker is to share in God's own work.

2. **Eschatological Dimension**: The promise "they will be called children of God" is future tense, pointing to God's coming kingdom where true peace will reign.

3. **Cost of Peacemaking**: Significantly, the next beatitude addresses persecution. Jesus acknowledges that true peacemaking often comes at great personal cost.

**Tension with Just War Theory**

Christian tradition has wrestled with how this teaching relates to questions of violence and warfare:

- **Pacifist Interpretation**: Groups like Mennonites and Quakers see this as an absolute prohibition against violence
- **Just War Theory**: Augustine and Thomas Aquinas argued that sometimes violence may be necessary to protect the innocent and maintain justice
- **Tension**: Both camps agree that peace is the ultimate goal; they differ on whether violence can ever be a means to that end

## Parallel Teachings Across Faiths

| Religion | Teaching | Similarity | Key Difference |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Islam** | "If they incline to peace, incline to it" (Quran 8:61) | Both emphasize choosing peace and reconciliation when possible | Islam provides specific conditions for when peace treaties are appropriate |
| **Buddhism** | Metta (loving-kindness) meditation | Both cultivate inner peace that radiates outward to others | Buddhism emphasizes meditation practice; Christianity emphasizes active reconciliation |
| **Hinduism** | Ahimsa (non-violence) in thought, word, and deed | Both see peace as comprehensive—affecting all aspects of life | Ahimsa focuses on non-harm; Jesus focuses on active reconciliation |
| **Judaism** | "Seek peace and pursue it" (Psalm 34:14) | Both make peace an active pursuit, not passive state | Jesus frames it as participation in divine sonship |

## Modern Application

### Personal Practice

**In Daily Life:**
- When you hear gossip about someone, choose not to spread it
- When friends are in conflict, offer to facilitate conversation
- When you're angry, take time to cool down before responding
- Practice active listening without immediately defending yourself

**In Family:**
- Don't take sides in family disputes; help everyone feel heard
- Model forgiveness and reconciliation for children
- Address conflicts directly rather than letting resentment build
- Create space for difficult conversations with compassion

### Social Impact

**Historical Examples:**
- **Martin Luther King Jr.** drew directly on the Sermon on the Mount for his nonviolent resistance movement
- **Desmond Tutu** led South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, choosing healing over revenge
- **Jean Vanier** founded L'Arche communities where people with and without disabilities live together in peace

**Contemporary Peacebuilding:**
- Interfaith dialogue initiatives bringing together Christians, Muslims, Jews, and others
- Restorative justice programs that prioritize healing over punishment
- Community mediation services that help neighbors resolve disputes
- Conflict resolution training in schools teaching children to be peacemakers

### Reflection Questions

**For Personal Reflection:**
1. Where in my life am I avoiding conflict rather than actively working for peace?
2. What relationships in my life need reconciliation right now?
3. How can I develop the skills of a peacemaker—listening, empathy, mediation?
4. What fears hold me back from being a peacemaker?

**For Group Discussion:**
1. How does Jesus's teaching on peacemaking challenge our culture's approach to conflict?
2. What does it mean that peacemakers are called "children of God"?
3. When have you seen someone successfully bring peace to a conflict? What did they do?
4. How can our community practice peacemaking at a local level?
