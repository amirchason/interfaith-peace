## Overview

In perhaps his most counterintuitive teaching, Jesus reinterprets the ancient principle of proportional justice ("an eye for an eye") and offers a radical alternative: non-retaliation combined with active, creative resistance. This teaching from the Sermon on the Mount has been misunderstood for centuries as advocating passive submission to abuse. However, contemporary scholarship reveals it as a revolutionary strategy for maintaining dignity, exposing injustice, and transforming adversarial relationships—all without resorting to violence.

Walter Wink's groundbreaking analysis demonstrates that Jesus isn't commanding victims to enable abusers, but rather prescribing specific actions that disarm oppressors through unexpected, non-violent responses that assert human dignity and create moral disruption.

## Sacred Text

### Original Greek (Matthew 5:38-42)
Ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἐρρέθη, Ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ καὶ ὀδόντα ἀντὶ ὀδόντος. ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν μὴ ἀντιστῆναι τῷ πονηρῷ· ἀλλ' ὅστις σε ῥαπίζει εἰς τὴν δεξιὰν σιαγόνα [σου], στρέψον αὐτῷ καὶ τὴν ἄλλην· καὶ τῷ θέλοντί σοι κριθῆναι καὶ τὸν χιτῶνά σου λαβεῖν, ἄφες αὐτῷ καὶ τὸ ἱμάτιον· καὶ ὅστις σε ἀγγαρεύσει μίλιον ἕν, ὕπαγε μετ' αὐτοῦ δύο. τῷ αἰτοῦντί σε δός, καὶ τὸν θέλοντα ἀπὸ σοῦ δανίσασθαι μὴ ἀποστραφῇς.

### Translation (NRSV)
> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you."

### Transliteration & Key Terms
- **ἀντιστῆναι** (antistēnai): "to resist" or "to set against violently"
- **ῥαπίζει** (rhapizei): "strikes with the back of the hand" (insult/humiliation)
- **δεξιὰν σιαγόνα** (dexian siagona): "right cheek" (specific cultural context)
- **χιτῶνα** (chitōna): "inner tunic" (undergarment)
- **ἱμάτιον** (himation): "outer cloak" (essential garment)
- **ἀγγαρεύσει** (angareusai): "compel to service" (Roman military term)

## Meaning & Interpretation

### For Beginners: Beyond Doormat Christianity

Many people hear this teaching and think Jesus is telling victims to be passive doormats, enabling abuse. **This is wrong.** Jesus is teaching a third way—neither fight nor flight, but creative non-violent resistance.

Imagine someone insults you publicly. The world offers two options:
1. **Hit back** (escalate to violence)
2. **Walk away silently** (accept humiliation)

Jesus offers a third option:
3. **Stand your ground with dignity** (refuse both violence and victimhood)

"Turn the other cheek" doesn't mean "let people abuse you repeatedly." It means: **"I refuse to respond with violence, but I also refuse to be humiliated. I assert my dignity as a human being created in God's image."**

### For Intermediate Students: Cultural Context Reveals Revolutionary Strategy

To understand this teaching, we must understand three specific scenarios Jesus describes, all grounded in first-century Palestinian social realities:

#### 1. The Right Cheek Strike (v. 39)
A strike on the **right** cheek (not left) is significant. In a right-handed society, hitting someone's right cheek requires using the **back of the hand**—a gesture of insult used by superiors against inferiors (masters to slaves, Romans to Jews, men to women).

**What "turning the other cheek" does:**
- Forces the aggressor to either stop or use an **open-handed slap**
- An open-handed slap treats the person as an **equal**, not an inferior
- This non-violent act **robs the oppressor of their power to humiliate**
- It says: "I am your equal. Try again."

#### 2. The Inner Garment in Court (v. 40)
Jewish law allowed creditors to sue for someone's outer cloak (himation) but required returning it by nightfall (Exodus 22:26-27). Jesus says: if they sue for your inner tunic (chiton), **give them your outer cloak too**—leaving you **naked**.

**What this does:**
- Public nudity **shamed the viewer**, not the naked person (Genesis 9:20-27)
- It exposes the creditor's **injustice**—taking someone's last garment
- It's a prophetic act of **protest**, like Isaiah walking naked (Isaiah 20:2-4)
- It says: "You want everything? Here. Now everyone sees what you've done."

#### 3. The Second Mile (v. 41)
Roman soldiers could legally compel civilians (angareuo) to carry their equipment for **one mile**—a hated practice. Going a **second mile** creates a problem for the soldier:

**What this does:**
- Roman military law **prohibited** compelling service beyond one mile
- If the soldier allows it, **he risks punishment**
- Suddenly the **power dynamic reverses**—the civilian is in control
- It says: "I'm not your beast of burden. I'm a person making a free choice."

### For Advanced Students: Theological & Ethical Implications

#### Reinterpreting Lex Talionis (Eye for Eye)
Jesus begins by quoting **lex talionis** (Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, Deuteronomy 19:21)—"eye for an eye, tooth for tooth." This wasn't originally about revenge, but about **proportional justice**: the punishment must fit the crime (no escalation). It was actually a **limit** on vengeance in ancient societies.

Jesus goes further: **don't retaliate at all.** But this isn't passive acceptance—it's **active transformation**.

#### The Meaning of "Do Not Resist" (μὴ ἀντιστῆναι)
The Greek word **antistēnai** means "to resist violently" or "to set against in battle." It's used in military contexts. Jesus is **not** saying:
- ❌ "Don't resist injustice"
- ❌ "Don't protect yourself"
- ❌ "Accept abuse passively"

He **is** saying:
- ✅ "Don't resist **violently**"
- ✅ "Don't mirror your enemy's tactics"
- ✅ "Find a third way that preserves dignity and reveals truth"

#### Walter Wink's Third Way Framework
Theologian Walter Wink (1935-2012) revolutionized interpretation of this passage in his "Powers" trilogy. He identified Jesus's teaching as a **third way** between:

**NOT:**
- Flight (passive submission)
- Fight (violent resistance)

**BUT:**
- **Active non-violent resistance** that:
  - Asserts human dignity
  - Exposes injustice
  - Seizes moral initiative
  - Refuses to be defined by the enemy's categories

This is the same strategy used by:
- Gandhi's independence movement (inspired by Sermon on the Mount)
- Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights campaign
- Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid resistance
- Solidarity movement in Poland

#### Relationship to Enemy Love (vv. 43-48)
This passage immediately precedes Jesus's teaching to "love your enemies" (vv. 43-48). The connection is crucial:

**Retaliation** says: "You are my enemy. I will destroy you."
**Passivity** says: "You are my master. I am powerless."
**Jesus's third way** says: "You are a human being. I will treat you as such, even as I resist your evil actions."

This is **enemy love in action**—refusing to dehumanize the oppressor while refusing to accept oppression.

## Historical Context

### First-Century Palestine Under Roman Occupation

Jesus spoke these words to people living under **Roman military occupation**. They faced:
- Random violence from Roman soldiers
- Economic exploitation through taxation
- Public humiliation to maintain social hierarchy
- Legal systems rigged against the poor

The Jewish resistance movements of Jesus's era fell into two camps:
1. **Zealots**: Advocated armed rebellion (led to 70 CE destruction)
2. **Essenes/Pharisees**: Advocated withdrawal or compliance

Jesus offers a **third path**: neither armed revolt nor passive acceptance, but **creative, dignified, non-violent resistance** that exposes injustice and asserts common humanity.

### Torah Background: Evolution of Justice Principles

Jesus's audience would immediately recognize his reinterpretation of **Torah justice principles**:

**Genesis 4:23-24** - Lamech's unlimited revenge:
> "I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."

**Exodus 21:23-25** - Limited, proportional justice:
> "If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."

**Leviticus 19:18** - Moving beyond retaliation:
> "You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord."

**Matthew 5:38-48** - Complete transformation:
> "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."

Jesus completes an arc that moves from **unlimited revenge** → **proportional justice** → **no retaliation** → **active love**.

## Classical Scholarly Commentary

### Early Church Fathers: Struggle with Radical Demands

#### St. Augustine (354-430 CE)
Augustine distinguished between **internal disposition** and **external action**:

> "What is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart... A righteous man may without any loss of righteousness go to war at the command of God."

**Critique**: This interpretation allowed Christians to serve in Roman military while claiming to follow Jesus's teaching. It spiritualizes the text in a way that may evade its concrete political implications.

#### St. John Chrysostom (347-407 CE)
Chrysostom emphasized the **transformative power** of non-retaliation:

> "For he that requites the evil doer with evil, is himself also an evil doer... But he that suffers wrong, and avenges not himself, is a noble and great man."

He saw this teaching as creating **moral superiority** that could shame aggressors into repentance.

#### Tertullian (155-220 CE)
Tertullian took the teaching literally and forbade Christians from military service:

> "The Lord, in disarming Peter, disarmed every soldier thereafter."

Early Christianity was largely **pacifist** until Constantine (313 CE).

### Medieval Interpretations: Two Kingdoms Theology

#### St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)
Aquinas distinguished between **individual ethics** and **state responsibility**:

- **Individuals**: Must not retaliate; must forgive
- **State**: Has God-given authority to punish evildoers (Romans 13:1-4)

This created the **two kingdoms** framework that dominated Christian political thought, allowing rulers to wage war while individuals practiced mercy.

### Reformation: Return to Radical Discipleship

#### Anabaptists (1525-)
Groups like the Mennonites and Amish took Jesus's teaching **literally**:

- Refused military service
- Practiced **complete non-resistance**
- Accepted martyrdom rather than violence
- Created communities of **radical discipleship**

The **Schleitheim Confession** (1527) states:
> "The sword is ordained of God outside the perfection of Christ. It punishes and puts to death the wicked, and guards and protects the good... Within the perfection of Christ, however, only the ban is used for a warning and for the excommunication of the one who has sinned."

---

## Modern Scholarly Commentary

### Walter Wink: The Third Way of Jesus

Walter Wink's **The Powers That Be** (1998) revolutionized interpretation:

> "The examples that follow [turning the other cheek, giving the cloak, going the second mile] are from the lives of the people whom Jesus is addressing. They are carefully chosen to show how a subjugated people can recover their humanity and begin to take back their power from their oppressors... Jesus is not advocating masochism or passivity in the face of injustice and evil. Nor is he sponsoring revenge. He is **formulating a third alternative** to both passivity and violence."

Wink demonstrates that each example:
1. Asserts the **dignity** of the oppressed
2. **Exposes** the injustice of the system
3. Seizes the **moral initiative**
4. Offers the oppressor a chance to **recognize common humanity**

### Dr. Amy-Jill Levine: Jewish Context of Torah Reinterpretation

Levine contextualizes Jesus within **Jewish debates** about Torah application:

> "Jesus is not abolishing Torah; he is intensifying it. The Pharisees debated how to apply 'eye for eye'—most agreed it meant monetary compensation, not literal mutilation. Jesus goes further: don't seek compensation at all. Transform the relationship."

She notes that Jewish tradition also moved toward mercy:
- **Talmud** (Baba Kamma 83b-84a): "Eye for eye" means financial restitution
- **Proverbs 25:21-22**: "If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat"

Jesus stands within this tradition while radicalizing it.

### Glen Stassen: Transforming Initiatives Framework

Glen Stassen argues Jesus's teaching follows a **triadic pattern**:

1. **Traditional righteousness**: "Eye for an eye"
2. **Vicious cycle**: Retaliation breeds retaliation
3. **Transforming initiative**: Active peacemaking breaks the cycle

This isn't just about avoiding sin, but about **actively transforming** the situation through creative love.

### Feminist & Liberation Theology Critiques

**Concern**: Has this teaching been used to keep **oppressed people** (especially women, enslaved people, colonized peoples) in submission?

**Answer**: Yes, when misinterpreted as **passive submission**. But when understood as **active resistance**, it becomes a tool for liberation:

- **Domestic violence**: Victims should NOT "turn the other cheek" to continued abuse. Safety first. Jesus opposed exploitation.
- **Structural injustice**: The teaching calls for **exposing** injustice, not accepting it
- **Colonization**: Gandhi and King used this framework to **dismantle empire**

The key question: Who has **power** in the relationship? Jesus addresses people resisting **oppression**, not people enabling **abuse**.

## Modern Application

### 1. Criminal Justice Reform

Jesus's teaching challenges **retributive justice** (punishment focused) and supports **restorative justice** (healing focused):

**Traditional**: "You hurt someone, so we hurt you" (prison, execution)
**Jesus**: "How do we restore relationships and prevent future harm?"

**Restorative Justice Practices:**
- Victim-offender mediation
- Truth and reconciliation commissions (South Africa)
- Community accountability processes
- Transformative justice in indigenous communities

**Scripture Connection**: Jesus's teaching anticipates modern criminology research showing:
- Punishment alone doesn't reduce recidivism
- Revenge satisfies briefly but perpetuates cycles
- Transformation requires **seeing humanity** in offender

### 2. Workplace Conflict Resolution

**Scenario**: Your colleague publicly criticizes your work unfairly in a meeting.

**Fight Response**: Attack them back publicly (escalation)
**Flight Response**: Say nothing, internalize hurt (resentment)
**Jesus's Third Way**:
1. Address it directly but non-defensively: "I noticed you had concerns about my work. Let's discuss this privately so I can understand and we can find solutions."
2. This asserts your **dignity** (I won't be humiliated)
3. Offers a **constructive path** (private discussion)
4. Maintains **professional relationship** (we can solve this)

### 3. Online Harassment & Cancel Culture

The digital age creates new arenas for retaliation cycles:

**Retaliation**: "They attacked me online, so I'll mobilize my followers to attack them"
**Jesus's Approach**:
- Don't mirror the attack
- Expose the behavior by not engaging in it
- Maintain your own integrity
- Seek understanding, even of enemies

**Example**: When actor Mark Ruffalo receives hateful messages, he often responds with questions: "What hurt led you to write this? I'd like to understand." This disarms without retaliating.

### 4. Police Reform & Use of Force

**Question**: Should police "turn the other cheek"?

**Answer**: Jesus's teaching is about **de-escalation** and **proportionality**:
- Use **minimal necessary force** (not retaliation)
- Prioritize **protecting life** (including suspect's)
- See suspects as **humans**, not enemies
- **Creative problem-solving** over violence

Modern police reform movements advocate:
- Crisis intervention training
- De-escalation techniques
- Restorative justice partnerships
- Racial bias training

All align with Jesus's third way: neither dangerous passivity nor excessive force, but **dignified, creative, minimal-harm intervention**.

### 5. International Relations & War

**Hardest Question**: Does this teaching apply to **national defense**?

**Spectrum of Christian Views:**

**Pacifist** (Anabaptist, Quaker): Yes, absolutely. No Christian should participate in war.

**Just War** (Augustine, Aquinas): Individuals turn other cheek, but **states** have responsibility to defend innocent.

**Realism** (Niebuhr): Jesus's teaching is an **impossible ideal** for political life; we must accept necessary evil.

**Active Non-Violence** (King, Day): Jesus's teaching is **politically realistic**; non-violent resistance can defeat evil empires (it worked against British Empire, Jim Crow, Soviet Union).

**Scripture's Challenge**: Jesus doesn't carve out exceptions for "legitimate violence." He knew Rome (a violent empire) yet said nothing like "except when Caesar requires it."

### 6. Personal Relationships: Boundaries vs. Enabling

**Critical Distinction:**

✅ **Healthy Boundary**: "I will not retaliate against you, but I also will not allow continued abuse. I'm removing myself from this unsafe situation."

❌ **Enabling**: "You can hurt me repeatedly, and I'll accept it because Jesus said turn the other cheek."

**Jesus is NOT saying:**
- Stay in abusive relationships
- Allow yourself to be repeatedly harmed
- Endanger yourself or others
- Enable addiction or destructive behavior

**Jesus IS saying:**
- When you set boundaries, do so without **revenge**
- When you protect yourself, don't **dehumanize** the other
- When you confront evil, use methods that **preserve dignity**
- Your goal is **transformation**, not retaliation

## Reflection Questions

### Personal Examination
1. Think of a recent conflict where you felt wronged. Did you respond with fight, flight, or a creative third way?

2. Have you ever confused "turning the other cheek" with enabling abuse or injustice? How can you maintain both non-retaliation and healthy boundaries?

3. What would it look like to respond to your most challenging relationship with Jesus's third-way strategy?

### Social Analysis
4. Where do you see **retaliation cycles** in your community, nation, or world? How might Jesus's teaching break these cycles?

5. How has "turn the other cheek" been misused to keep oppressed people in submission? How can we reclaim its revolutionary meaning?

6. What would a criminal justice system look like if it prioritized **restoration** over **retribution**?

### Spiritual Practice
7. Who do you struggle to see as fully human? How might Jesus's teaching help you restore their humanity in your eyes?

8. In what situations are you tempted toward either **passive submission** or **violent retaliation**? What creative third way might exist?

9. How can you practice **active love** toward someone who has harmed you, while maintaining appropriate boundaries?

### Interfaith Dialogue
10. Compare Jesus's teaching with ahimsa (Hinduism), metta (Buddhism), or Quranic forgiveness (Islam). What do they share? How do they differ?

11. Why do you think **non-retaliation** appears across so many spiritual traditions? What does this say about human nature and peacemaking?

## Prayer & Practice

### Daily Practices

#### Morning Intention
*Before facing potential conflicts:*

> "Today I will encounter people who frustrate, insult, or oppose me. In these moments, grant me the creativity to respond neither with violence nor with passivity, but with dignity, truth, and love. Help me see your image even in those who wrong me. May I be an agent of transformation, not retaliation."

#### Breath Prayer for Non-Retaliation
*When feeling provoked:*

**Inhale**: *"I will not mirror your violence"*
**Exhale**: *"I will show you a better way"*

*(Repeat 5 times before responding to provocation)*

#### Evening Examination
*Reflect on the day's conflicts:*

1. When did I face hostility or wrong today?
2. How did I respond? (Fight, flight, or third way?)
3. Did I retaliate in any way? (Physical, verbal, emotional, online)
4. Did I preserve dignity—mine and the other person's?
5. What would Jesus's creative third way have looked like?
6. Tomorrow, what will I do differently?

### Community Practices

#### Conflict Transformation Workshop
Gather your faith community to practice Jesus's third-way responses:

**Roleplay Scenarios:**
- Workplace insult
- Online harassment
- Family betrayal
- Neighbor conflict
- Systemic injustice

**Practice:**
1. Act out **fight** response (what most people do)
2. Act out **flight** response (passive submission)
3. **Brainstorm** creative third ways (Wink's framework)
4. Act out third-way response
5. Reflect: How did it feel? What changed?

#### Restorative Justice Circle
When harm occurs in your community:

1. **Acknowledge harm**: What happened? Who was hurt?
2. **Invite accountability**: What responsibility does the person who harmed take?
3. **Seek restoration**: What would repair look like?
4. **Commit to change**: What will prevent this in the future?
5. **Reintegrate**: How do we restore relationships?

(This is Jesus's third way applied to conflict resolution.)

### Social Action

#### Campaign for Restorative Justice
Work to replace retributive systems with restorative ones:

- **Juvenile Justice**: Advocate for diversion programs instead of incarceration
- **Schools**: Replace zero-tolerance policies with restorative circles
- **Prisons**: Support transitional programs and re-entry services
- **Victim Services**: Promote victim-offender mediation where appropriate

#### Non-Violent Direct Action
Join movements using Jesus's third-way tactics:

- **Civil Rights**: Study SCLC and SNCC strategies
- **Climate**: Support non-violent civil disobedience (Extinction Rebellion)
- **Labor**: Participate in strikes, boycotts (not violence)
- **Peace**: Join Christian Peacemaker Teams in conflict zones

### Contemplative Practice: Loving Your Enemy in Imagination

**20-Minute Guided Meditation:**

1. **Settle** (5 min): Sit comfortably. Breathe. Center in God's presence.

2. **Recall** (5 min): Bring to mind someone who has wronged you. Notice your body's reaction—tightness, heat, tension. Don't push it away. Just notice.

3. **See Their Humanity** (5 min): Imagine this person as a baby. Someone loved them. They have fears, wounds, unmet needs. What pain might drive their behavior? (Not excusing—understanding.)

4. **Pray for Them** (3 min): Following Jesus's command (Matt 5:44), pray:
   - "May they be free from suffering"
   - "May they know they are loved"
   - "May they be healed of whatever drives them to harm"
   - "May our conflict be transformed"

5. **Imagine Transformation** (2 min): Visualize a future where you and this person relate with dignity, honesty, maybe even reconciliation. What would that look like?

6. **Return to Center**: Breathe. Release the meditation. Carry this shifted perspective into your day.

**Note**: If trauma from abuse, do this practice only with a therapist's support.
