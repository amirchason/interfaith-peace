## Introduction

**"Israel" appears 2,565 times in the Bible**, making it one of the most frequently mentioned words in Scripture. But what does "Israel" actually mean? The answer is more complex—and more beautiful—than most people realize.

"Israel" is:
- ✅ **A person** (Jacob, renamed by God in Genesis 32:28)
- ✅ **A nation** (the twelve tribes descended from Jacob's sons)
- ✅ **A kingdom** (united under Saul, David, Solomon; later divided into Israel and Judah)
- ✅ **A land** (the Promised Land given to Abraham's descendants)
- ✅ **A theological concept** (God's covenant people, both physical and spiritual)
- ✅ **A prophetic hope** (restoration, Messianic peace, and universal blessing)

This comprehensive guide explores **Israel in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation**, examining:
- ✅ **Etymology:** What "Israel" means (יִשְׂרָאֵל, *Yisrael* - "struggles with God" or "God prevails")
- ✅ **Biblical narrative:** Jacob's story, the Exodus, conquest, kingdom, exile, and return
- ✅ **Covenant theology:** Abraham, Moses, David—God's promises to Israel
- ✅ **Peace prophecies:** Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel's visions of restored, peaceful Israel
- ✅ **Jesus and Israel:** His identity as Israel's Messiah, teaching to/about Israel
- ✅ **Paul's theology:** Romans 9-11—Israel's present status and future hope
- ✅ **Modern relevance:** What biblical Israel means for Jewish, Christian, and Muslim understanding today

**Important Note:** This article focuses on **biblical, historical, and theological Israel**—not modern geopolitical issues. Our goal is to understand Scripture's teaching about Israel to foster interfaith understanding and prayers for peace in the Holy Land.

## Part I: Origins — Jacob Becomes Israel

### 1. The Wrestling at Peniel: Jacob Renamed (Genesis 32:22-32) ⭐ FOUNDATIONAL

**Hebrew:**
> וַיִּוָּתֵר יַעֲקֹב לְבַדּוֹ וַיֵּאָבֵק אִישׁ עִמּוֹ עַד עֲלוֹת הַשָּׁחַר... וַיֹּאמֶר לֹא יַעֲקֹב יֵאָמֵר עוֹד שִׁמְךָ כִּי אִם־**יִשְׂרָאֵל** כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים וַתּוּכָל

**Transliteration:**
*Vayivater Ya'akov levado, vaye'avek ish imo ad alot hashachar... Vayomer lo Ya'akov ye'amer od shimcha ki im **Yisrael**, ki-sarita im-Elohim ve'im-anashim vatuchal*

**Translation:**
"So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak... Then the man said, 'Your name will no longer be Jacob, but **Israel**, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.'"

**Context:**

Jacob is returning to Canaan after 20 years in Haran (modern Syria/Iraq). He's terrified because he's about to meet his brother Esau, whom he cheated out of birthright and blessing 20 years earlier (Genesis 27). Esau is coming with 400 men—Jacob fears massacre.

The night before the meeting, Jacob sends his family across the Jabbok River and stays alone. A mysterious figure appears and wrestles him until dawn.

**The Name Change:**

| **Old Name** | **Meaning** | **Character** |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Jacob** (*Ya'akov*, יַעֲקֹב) | "Heel-grabber" or "supplanter" | Deceiver, manipulator, cheated brother and father |
| **Israel** (*Yisrael*, יִשְׂרָאֵל) | "He struggles with God" or "God prevails" | One who wrestles with God, transformed, persistent in faith |

**Etymology Debate:**

The name "Israel" (*Yisrael*) is a compound:
- ***Yisra*** (יִשְׂרָ): From *sarah* (שָׂרָה), "to struggle, contend, persist"
- ***El*** (אֵל): "God"

**Two possible interpretations:**
1. **"He struggles with God"** (active voice): Jacob's persistent wrestling represents Israel's destiny—a people who contend with God in faith
2. **"God prevails"** (passive/causative): Despite Jacob's struggles, God's purposes triumph

**Both interpretations are valid** and reflect Israel's dual nature: A people chosen by God's grace, yet often resisting God's will.

**Hosea's Commentary (12:3-4):**

"In the womb he grasped his brother's heel; as a man he **struggled with God**. He struggled with the angel and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor."

The prophet Hosea sees this event as definitive for Israel's identity: **A nation that struggles with God yet ultimately seeks His favor.**

**Theological Significance:**

1. **God initiates transformation:** God comes to Jacob (not vice versa) and forces the encounter
2. **Struggle produces blessing:** Jacob is wounded (hip dislocated) but receives new name and blessing
3. **Face-to-face with God:** Jacob declares, "I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared" (32:30)—foreshadowing Israel's unique relationship with God
4. **Identity shift:** From deceiver to struggler-with-God—from self-reliant manipulator to God-dependent wrestler

**Rabbi Jonathan Sacks (Former Chief Rabbi of UK):**
"Israel is the people who wrestle with God and with man. That is what Jews have always done, and it is the source of our spiritual and intellectual energy. We do not accept the world as it is. We challenge it in the name of a higher vision."

---

### 2. The Twelve Tribes of Israel (Genesis 29-30, 35:22-26)

Jacob (now Israel) has **twelve sons** by four women (Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, Zilpah). These sons become the patriarchs of the twelve tribes:

| **Son** | **Meaning** | **Mother** | **Tribal Territory (Later)** |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1. **Reuben** | "See, a son!" | Leah | East of Jordan |
| 2. **Simeon** | "Heard" | Leah | Absorbed into Judah |
| 3. **Levi** | "Attached" | Leah | No territory (priestly tribe) |
| 4. **Judah** | "Praise" | Leah | Southern kingdom; Davidic line |
| 5. **Dan** | "Judge" | Bilhah | Northern border |
| 6. **Naphtali** | "Wrestling" | Bilhah | Northern Galilee |
| 7. **Gad** | "Fortune" | Zilpah | East of Jordan |
| 8. **Asher** | "Happy" | Zilpah | Coastal region |
| 9. **Issachar** | "Reward" | Leah | Jezreel Valley |
| 10. **Zebulun** | "Honor" | Leah | Lower Galilee |
| 11. **Joseph** | "May he add" | Rachel | Split into Ephraim & Manasseh |
| 12. **Benjamin** | "Son of right hand" | Rachel | Jerusalem region |

**Why Twelve Tribes Matter:**

- **Twelve** is a number of **completeness/governance** in Scripture (12 months, 12 apostles, 12 gates in Revelation)
- These tribes become the **structure of Israelite society** for 1,000+ years
- Prophetic promises often reference "**all twelve tribes of Israel**" (Ezekiel 48, Revelation 7:4-8)

**Genesis 49: Jacob's Blessings**

Before his death, Jacob prophesies over each son. Key excerpts:

**Judah (49:10):**
> "The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, **until he to whom it belongs shall come** and the obedience of the nations shall be his."

**Jewish and Christian interpretation:** Messiah will come from Judah's line (fulfilled in Jesus, "Lion of Judah," Revelation 5:5).

**Joseph (49:22-26):**
> "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring... Because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the skies above, blessings of the deep springs below..."

**Joseph receives double blessing** (through his sons Ephraim and Manasseh), making him the most prominent in Northern Kingdom.

---

## Part II: Nation Formation — Israel in Egypt and the Exodus

### 3. "Let My People Go" — Birth of the Nation (Exodus 1-15)

**Exodus 1:7:**
> "But the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that **the land was filled with them**."

**Context:**

Jacob's family (70 people, Genesis 46:27) migrated to Egypt during famine (~1876 BCE based on traditional chronology). After Joseph's death, **new Pharaoh enslaves them** (Exodus 1:8-14). By Moses's time (400+ years later), they number **~2 million** (600,000 men, Exodus 12:37).

**The Exodus Event:**

| **Element** | **Biblical Account** | **Theological Meaning** |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Ten Plagues** | God defeats Egyptian gods (Exodus 7-11) | Yahweh is supreme over all false deities |
| **Passover** | Lamb's blood saves firstborn (Exodus 12) | Substitutionary atonement (foreshadows Christ) |
| **Red Sea** | Waters part, Israel crosses, Egypt drowns (Exodus 14) | Baptism imagery (1 Cor 10:1-2); salvation through water |
| **Mount Sinai** | God gives Torah (Exodus 19-24) | Israel becomes covenant nation |
| **Tabernacle** | God dwells among people (Exodus 25-40) | Incarnation foreshadowed |

**Exodus 19:5-6 — Israel's Identity:**

> "Now if you obey me fully and **keep my covenant**, then out of all nations you will be **my treasured possession**. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a **kingdom of priests and a holy nation**."

**Three Key Terms:**

1. **"Treasured possession"** (*segullah*, סְגֻלָּה): Not "favorite" but "specially chosen for a purpose"
2. **"Kingdom of priests"** (*mamlekhet kohanim*, מַמְלֶכֶת כֹּהֲנִים): Israel mediates God to the nations (like priests mediate God to people)
3. **"Holy nation"** (*goy kadosh*, גּוֹי קָדוֹשׁ): Set apart for God's purposes, distinct in ethics and worship

**Dr. Walter Brueggemann (Old Testament Scholar):**
"Israel's election is not privilege without responsibility. To be chosen means to bear the weight of God's mission to the world—to embody justice, mercy, and the knowledge of Yahweh among the nations."

---

### 4. The Covenant at Sinai — Israel's Constitution (Exodus 19-24)

**The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17):**

God gives Israel the **Decalogue** (Ten Words), the core of Torah:

**Vertical Relationship (with God):**
1. No other gods
2. No idols
3. Don't misuse God's name
4. Keep Sabbath holy

**Horizontal Relationship (with others):**
5. Honor parents
6. Don't murder
7. Don't commit adultery
8. Don't steal
9. Don't lie
10. Don't covet

**Peace Implications:**

If Israel keeps these commands, they will have:
- **Peace with God** (commands 1-4)
- **Peace in families** (command 5)
- **Peace in society** (commands 6-10: no violence, sexual chaos, theft, dishonesty, envy)

**Deuteronomy 28: Blessings and Curses**

God promises:
- **Obedience → Blessing, peace, prosperity** (28:1-14)
- **Disobedience → Curses, war, exile** (28:15-68)

This covenant is **conditional**: Israel's peace depends on faithfulness to God.

---

## Part III: The Kingdom Period — United and Divided Israel

### 5. United Monarchy: Saul, David, Solomon (1050-930 BCE)

**1 Samuel 8: Israel Demands a King**

Israel asks prophet Samuel for a king "like all the other nations" (8:5). God warns this will lead to oppression but grants their request.

**King Saul (1050-1010 BCE):**
- First king, tribe of Benjamin
- Starts well, ends in disobedience and madness
- Loses dynasty due to unfaithfulness

**King David (1010-970 BCE):**

**2 Samuel 7:12-16 — The Davidic Covenant:**

> "When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, your own flesh and blood, and **I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever**."

**Key Promises:**

1. **Eternal dynasty**: Davidic line will never end
2. **Messiah will come from David's line**: "Son of David" becomes Messianic title
3. **Kingdom of peace**: Psalm 72 describes Davidic king bringing justice and peace

**Psalm 72:3, 7 (Davidic prayer):**
> "May the mountains bring **prosperity** to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness... **In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.**"

**Christian Interpretation:** Jesus fulfills Davidic covenant as eternal King (Luke 1:32-33).

**King Solomon (970-930 BCE):**

- Builds First Temple in Jerusalem (~960 BCE)
- Israel reaches peak territorial extent (1 Kings 4:21)
- Peace and prosperity: "During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, **lived in safety, everyone under their own vine and under their own fig tree**" (1 Kings 4:25)

**"Vine and fig tree"** becomes idiomatic for **peace and security** (Micah 4:4, Zechariah 3:10).

---

### 6. Divided Kingdom: Israel (North) vs. Judah (South) (930-586 BCE)

**1 Kings 12: The Split**

After Solomon's death, his son Rehoboam refuses to lighten tax burden. Ten northern tribes rebel under Jeroboam:

| **Northern Kingdom** | **Southern Kingdom** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **"Israel"** or **"Ephraim"** | **"Judah"** |
| 10 tribes | 2 tribes (Judah + Benjamin) |
| Capital: Samaria | Capital: Jerusalem |
| 19 kings, all wicked (per Bible) | 20 kings, some godly (Hezekiah, Josiah) |
| Fell to Assyria (722 BCE) | Fell to Babylon (586 BCE) |

**2 Kings 17:6-7, 18 (Fall of Northern Kingdom):**

> "In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria... All this took place **because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God**... So the LORD was very angry with Israel and **removed them from his presence**."

**The "Lost Ten Tribes":**

The ten northern tribes were assimilated into Assyrian Empire and largely disappeared from history (though some fled south to Judah). This creates the question: Who is "Israel" now?

**Answer in Prophets:** True Israel = those faithful to covenant, regardless of tribal identity (remnant theology).

---

## Part IV: Exile and Restoration — Israel's Darkest Hour and Hope

### 7. Babylonian Exile (586-538 BCE)

**2 Kings 25:8-11 (Destruction of Jerusalem):**

> "On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. He set fire to **the temple of the LORD**, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem... The whole Babylonian army... broke down the walls around Jerusalem."

**The Crisis:**

- **Temple destroyed**: God's dwelling place gone
- **Davidic king dethroned**: Covenant appears broken
- **Land lost**: Promised Land forfeited
- **Identity crisis**: Are we still Israel if we have no land, temple, or king?

**Prophetic Response:**

God sends prophets (Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel) to explain exile and promise restoration.

**Jeremiah 29:10-14 (Letter to Exiles):**

> "This is what the LORD says: '**When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place**. For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the LORD, 'plans to **prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future**. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.'"

**God's Message:**

1. **Exile has a time limit** (70 years)
2. **God has not abandoned Israel**
3. **Future restoration is certain**

---

### 8. Prophetic Peace Visions for Restored Israel

#### **Isaiah 2:2-4 — Swords into Plowshares ⭐ ICONIC PEACE PROPHECY**

**Hebrew:**
> וְהָיָה בְּאַחֲרִית הַיָּמִים... וְכִתְּתוּ חַרְבוֹתָם לְאִתִּים וַחֲנִיתוֹתֵיהֶם לְמַזְמֵרוֹת **לֹא־יִשָּׂא גוֹי אֶל־גּוֹי חֶרֶב וְלֹא־יִלְמְדוּ עוֹד מִלְחָמָה**

**Translation:**
"In the last days the mountain of the LORD's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains... **They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.**"

**Context:**

Isaiah (8th century BCE) prophesies a future when:
1. **Jerusalem becomes spiritual center** for all nations
2. **Torah goes out to the world** from Zion
3. **God arbitrates international disputes** (no more war)
4. **Weapons turned to farming tools** (universal peace)

**This verse is inscribed:**
- On the **Isaiah Wall** across from United Nations headquarters in NYC
- Multiple monuments worldwide as symbol of peace aspiration

**Jewish Interpretation:** Messiah will bring this era (Messianic Age or *Olam Ha-Ba*, World to Come).

**Christian Interpretation:** Jesus's first coming initiated this; full realization at Second Coming.

---

#### **Isaiah 11:6-9 — The Peaceable Kingdom**

**Hebrew:**
> וְגָר זְאֵב עִם־כֶּבֶשׂ וְנָמֵר עִם־גְּדִי יִרְבָּץ... **לֹא־יָרֵעוּ וְלֹא־יַשְׁחִיתוּ בְּכָל־הַר קָדְשִׁי כִּי־מָלְאָה הָאָרֶץ דֵּעָה אֶת־יְהוָה**

**Translation:**
"The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them... **They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.**"

**Symbolism:**

| **Animal Pair** | **Represents** |
|---------------|---------------|
| Wolf + lamb | Predator + prey reconciled |
| Leopard + goat | Natural enemies in peace |
| Lion + calf | Strength + weakness coexist |
| Child leads them | Innocence and vulnerability safe |

**Theological Meaning:**

- **Creation restored**: Curse of Genesis 3 reversed
- **Perfect peace**: No violence even in animal kingdom
- **Knowledge of God universal**: Root cause of conflict (ignorance of God) eliminated

**Edward Hicks's "Peaceable Kingdom"** (1826 painting): American Quaker artist painted 60+ versions of this scene, often with William Penn negotiating peace treaty with Native Americans in background—linking biblical peace vision to contemporary peacemaking.

---

#### **Ezekiel 37:21-28 — Reunited Israel Under One King**

**Hebrew:**
> כֹּה־אָמַר אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה הִנֵּה אֲנִי לֹקֵחַ אֶת־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִבֵּין הַגּוֹיִם... וְנָתַתִּי אוֹתָם בְּאַרְצָם... **וּדָוִד עַבְדִּי מֶלֶךְ עֲלֵיהֶם וְרוֹעֶה אֶחָד יִהְיֶה לְכֻלָּם**

**Translation:**
"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will take the Israelites out of the nations where they have gone... I will settle them in their own land... **My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd.**"

**Context:**

After the famous "dry bones" vision (Ezekiel 37:1-14, symbolizing Israel's restoration from exile), God promises:

1. **Reunification**: North and South become one again
2. **One Davidic king**: Messiah figure who rules united Israel
3. **Eternal covenant of peace**: "I will make a **covenant of peace** with them; it will be an **everlasting covenant**" (37:26)
4. **God's sanctuary among them**: Temple rebuilt, God's presence returns

**Ezekiel 37:26:**
> "I will make a **covenant of peace** with them; it will be an **everlasting covenant**. I will establish them and increase their numbers, and I will put my sanctuary among them forever."

---

### 9. Return from Exile (538 BCE) — Partial Restoration

**Ezra 1:1-4:**

> "In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm... '**The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.**'"

**Key Events:**

| **Year** | **Event** | **Leader** |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 538 BCE | First return, altar rebuilt | Zerubbabel |
| 516 BCE | Second Temple completed | Zerubbabel, Joshua (high priest) |
| 458 BCE | Second return, Torah teaching | Ezra |
| 445 BCE | Walls of Jerusalem rebuilt | Nehemiah |

**Partial Nature of Restoration:**

**Fulfillment:**
✅ Temple rebuilt (though less glorious than Solomon's, Ezra 3:12)
✅ Altar re-established, sacrifices resumed
✅ Some exiles returned (~50,000)

**Unfulfilled Promises:**
❌ Not all tribes returned (mostly Judah, Benjamin, some Levi)
❌ No Davidic king restored (under Persian rule, then Greek, then Roman)
❌ No universal peace (still under foreign domination)
❌ Prophetic visions (Isaiah 11, Ezekiel 37) not realized

**Theological Question:** When will the fullness of restoration come? Jewish and Christian answers differ (Messiah still to come vs. Jesus as Messiah who will return).

---

## Part V: Jesus and Israel — Messiah, Rejection, and New Covenant

### 10. Jesus as Israel's Messiah

**Matthew 2:15 (Quoting Hosea 11:1):**
> "And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: '**Out of Egypt I called my son**.'"

**Context:**

Matthew applies Hosea 11:1 (originally about Israel's Exodus) to Jesus's return from Egypt as an infant. **Jesus recapitulates Israel's story**:

| **Israel's History** | **Jesus's Life** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Exodus from Egypt | Flees to Egypt, returns (Matt 2:13-15) |
| 40 years in wilderness | 40 days fasting in wilderness (Matt 4:1-11) |
| Tested, often failed | Tested, perfectly obedient |
| Received Law at Sinai | Gives new interpretation on mountain (Sermon on Mount, Matt 5-7) |
| Twelve tribes | Twelve apostles (Matt 10:1-4) |
| Passover lamb sacrificed | "Christ our Passover lamb sacrificed" (1 Cor 5:7) |

**Jesus is "True Israel"**—the faithful Israelite who succeeds where national Israel failed.

---

### 11. Jesus's Mission Statement (Matthew 15:24)

**Greek:**
> Οὐκ ἀπεστάλην εἰ μὴ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἀπολωλότα **οἴκου Ἰσραήλ**

**Translation:**
"I was sent only to **the lost sheep of Israel**."

**Context:**

A Canaanite woman asks Jesus to heal her daughter. Jesus initially refuses, stating his mission is to Israel. (He ultimately heals her anyway, Matthew 15:28, foreshadowing Gentile inclusion.)

**Jesus's Israelocentric Ministry:**

- Ministered primarily in Galilee and Judea (Jewish regions)
- Sent disciples "only to the lost sheep of Israel" initially (Matt 10:5-6)
- Taught in synagogues, quoted Hebrew Scriptures constantly
- Presented himself as fulfillment of Israel's messianic hopes

**But Also Universal:**

- "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also" (John 10:16)
- Great Commission: "Go and make disciples of **all nations**" (Matt 28:19)
- Paul's mission to Gentiles explicitly authorized (Acts 9:15)

---

### 12. Jesus Weeps Over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41-44)

**Greek:**
> Καὶ ὡς ἤγγισεν, ἰδὼν τὴν πόλιν **ἔκλαυσεν** ἐπ' αὐτὴν λέγων, Εἰ ἔγνως... τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην σου

**Translation:**
"As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, **he wept over it** and said, 'If you, even you, had only known on this day **what would bring you peace**—but now it is hidden from your eyes.'"

**Context:**

Palm Sunday—crowds hail Jesus as Messiah. But Jesus knows Jerusalem will reject him and face destruction (fulfilled in 70 CE when Romans destroy city and temple).

**Jesus's Lament:**

- **"What would bring you peace"** (*ta pros eirēnēn sou*, τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην σου): Jesus is the peace-bringer Israel missed
- Prophecy of destruction: "They will not leave one stone on another" (19:44)—fulfilled 40 years later

**Matthew 23:37:**
> "**Jerusalem, Jerusalem**, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing."

**Jesus's love for Israel:** Despite rejection, He weeps—not in anger but sorrow.

---

## Part VI: Paul's Theology — Israel's Present and Future (Romans 9-11)

### 13. "Has God Rejected His People?" (Romans 11:1-2) ⭐ CRITICAL PASSAGE

**Greek:**
> Λέγω οὖν, **μὴ ἀπώσατο ὁ θεὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ;** μὴ γένοιτο... **Οὐκ ἀπώσατο ὁ θεὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ** ὃν προέγνω

**Translation:**
"I ask then: **Has God rejected his people?** By no means!... **God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew.**"

**Context:**

Romans 9-11 is Paul's extended meditation on Israel's role after Jesus. Key questions:
1. Has Israel's rejection of Messiah nullified God's covenant?
2. Who is "true Israel"—ethnic descendants or believers?
3. What is Israel's future?

**Paul's Argument (Simplified):**

**Romans 9: God's Sovereign Choice**
- God chooses whom He wills (Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau)
- Not all ethnic Israel are "Israel" (9:6)—election is by faith, not ethnicity

**Romans 10: Israel's Stumbling**
- Israel pursued righteousness by works, not faith (10:3)
- "Christ is the culmination of the law" (10:4)
- Gospel is for "everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile" (1:16)

**Romans 11: Israel's Future Hope**
- Present: Partial hardening of Israel (11:25)
- Gentiles grafted into "olive tree" (Israel's covenant) (11:17-24)
- Future: "**All Israel will be saved**" (11:26)

---

### 14. "All Israel Will Be Saved" (Romans 11:25-27)

**Greek:**
> Πώρωσις ἀπὸ μέρους τῷ Ἰσραὴλ γέγονεν ἄχρις οὗ τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν ἐθνῶν εἰσέλθῃ, καὶ οὕτως **πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ σωθήσεται**

**Translation:**
"Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way **all Israel will be saved**."

**Three Major Interpretations:**

| **View** | **"All Israel" Means** | **Proponents** |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| **1. Ethnic Israel** | Future mass conversion of Jews to Jesus as Messiah | Many evangelicals, Messianic Jews |
| **2. Spiritual Israel** | All believers (Jew + Gentile) are "true Israel" | Augustine, Reformed tradition |
| **3. Corporate Israel** | Israel as a people will be preserved and blessed, ultimate faith uncertain | Some modern scholars |

**Paul's Own Words:**

- "God's gifts and his call are **irrevocable**" (11:29)
- "As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, **they are loved on account of the patriarchs**" (11:28)

**Implications for Peace:**

Regardless of interpretation, Paul insists:
1. **Christians must not be arrogant** toward Jews (11:18-20)
2. **God has not abandoned Israel** (11:1-2)
3. **Mystery of God's plan**: Jew and Gentile both saved by grace through faith

**Romans 11:33:**
> "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!"

## Part VII: Prayers for Israel's Peace

### 15. Psalm 122:6-9 — "Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem"

**Hebrew:**
> **שַׁאֲלוּ שְׁלוֹם יְרוּשָׁלָ͏ִם** יִשְׁלָיוּ אֹהֲבָיִךְ

**Transliteration:**
***Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim**, yishlayu ohavayich*

**Translation:**
"**Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:** 'May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.' For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, '**Peace be within you.**'"

**Context:**

Psalm 122 is a "Song of Ascents"—sung by pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem for festivals. It expresses love for the city and longing for its peace.

**Why Pray for Jerusalem?**

1. **Religious significance**: Holy to Judaism (Temple Mount), Christianity (crucifixion/resurrection sites), and Islam (Dome of the Rock, Al-Aqsa Mosque)
2. **Symbol of God's presence**: "The LORD has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling" (Psalm 132:13)
3. **Eschatological hope**: Jerusalem features prominently in end-times prophecies (Zechariah 14, Revelation 21)

**Modern Application:**

Jews, Christians, and Muslims worldwide pray for Jerusalem's peace—though defining "peace" differs:
- **Some pray for political resolution** (two-state solution, shared sovereignty, etc.)
- **Others pray for spiritual restoration** (Messiah's coming, Temple rebuilding, universal worship)
- **All can agree**: Current conflict grieves God; peace is God's will

**Bridge-Building Approach:**

Rather than taking political sides, people of faith can:
- Pray for safety of all residents (Israeli Jews, Palestinian Arabs—both Muslim and Christian)
- Support humanitarian aid organizations
- Oppose violence from all parties
- Work toward justice, reconciliation, mutual recognition

### 16. Zechariah 8:3-8 — God's Promise to Return to Zion

**Hebrew:**
> כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה **שַׁבְתִּי אֶל־צִיּוֹן** וְשָׁכַנְתִּי בְּתוֹךְ יְרוּשָׁלָ͏ִם וְנִקְרְאָה יְרוּשָׁלַ͏ִם עִיר־הָאֱמֶת

**Translation:**
"This is what the LORD says: '**I will return to Zion** and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the LORD Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.'"

**Context:**

Zechariah prophesies after exile (520-518 BCE) about Jerusalem's glorious future. The city will be so peaceful that:
- Old men and women sit safely in streets (8:4)
- Children play in the streets (8:5)—symbol of security
- People from many nations come to seek the LORD (8:20-23)

**Zechariah 8:19:**
> "This is what the LORD Almighty says: 'The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become **joyful and glad occasions** and **happy festivals** for Judah. Therefore **love truth and peace**.'"

## Part VIII: Modern Interfaith Perspectives

### 17. What Biblical Israel Means Today

**Jewish Perspective:**

- **Covenant remains**: God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob are eternal and unconditional (Genesis 17:7)
- **Land promise**: Connection to Land of Israel is theological, not just political
- **Messianic hope**: Still awaiting Messiah who will bring universal peace (Isaiah 2, 11)
- **Torah-centered**: Being Israel means living by Torah, not just ethnicity

**Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel:**
"Israel is a spiritual entity, a people called to holiness. The State of Israel is important, but it must embody the ethical vision of the prophets—justice, mercy, peace."

---

**Christian Perspective:**

**Diversity of views:**

1. **Replacement Theology** (Supersessionism): Church has "replaced" Israel as God's people; Old Testament promises fulfilled spiritually in Church

2. **Dual Covenant**: Israel and Church are both valid covenant communities with distinct paths to God

3. **Grafting/Olive Tree**: Gentiles grafted into Israel's covenant (Romans 11); one people of God (Jew + Gentile believers)

4. **Dispensationalism**: Israel and Church are distinct; Israel's promises will be fulfilled literally in future

**Common Ground:**

- Jesus is Jewish Messiah (even if Jews don't yet recognize Him)
- Christians are "spiritual children of Abraham" through faith (Galatians 3:7)
- Old Testament is Christian Scripture; Israel's story is our story
- Hope for Israel's salvation (Romans 11:26)

**Dr. N.T. Wright:**
"The question is not 'Has God finished with Israel?' but 'What is God doing with Israel?' And the answer is: incorporating Gentiles into the renewed Israel through Messiah Jesus."

---

**Muslim Perspective:**

- **Bani Israel** (Children of Israel) mentioned 40+ times in Quran
- Israelite prophets (Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus) are Islamic prophets
- **Quran 5:20-21**: Moses tells Israelites God has given them the land
- **But**: Covenant conditional on obedience; Israel repeatedly disobeyed (Quran 2:40, 83)
- **Modern State of Israel**: Theological significance debated; many Muslims separate biblical Israel from modern political state

**Dr. Tariq Ramadan (Muslim Scholar):**
"Muslims honor the Israelite prophets and recognize the historical connection of Jews to the Holy Land. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is political, not theological. We can distinguish between biblical Israel and contemporary politics."

## Conclusion: Israel as a Call to Peace

The Bible's portrait of Israel is complex, beautiful, and ultimately hopeful:

1. **Israel as person (Jacob)**: A struggler with God who is transformed by encounter with the Divine
2. **Israel as nation**: Chosen not for privilege but for mission—to bless all nations (Genesis 12:3)
3. **Israel as kingdom**: Rose to glory under David/Solomon, fell into idolatry and exile
4. **Israel as prophetic hope**: Visions of restored, peaceful Israel under Messiah's reign
5. **Israel in Jesus**: Messiah who embodies Israel's calling, offers peace through self-sacrifice
6. **Israel in Paul**: Mystery of Jew and Gentile united in Messiah, with future hope for "all Israel"

### The Peace Challenge:

Biblical Israel is fundamentally about **God's peace plan for the world**:
- **Genesis 12:3**: "All peoples on earth will be blessed through you"
- **Isaiah 42:6**: Israel (and Messiah) to be "a light for the Gentiles"
- **Zechariah 8:23**: "Ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, 'Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.'"

Whether one interprets these prophecies as fulfilled in Jesus, awaiting future Messiah, or both-and, **the biblical vision is universal peace radiating from Israel to the world.**

### A Prayer for Israel's Peace (Interfaith):

> *"God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Allah Most Merciful: You who chose Israel to be Your people and promised them peace: We pray for the peace of Jerusalem and all the Holy Land. Comfort those who grieve, heal ancient wounds, soften hardened hearts. Grant wisdom to leaders, courage to peacemakers, and hope to all who long for reconciliation. May descendants of Isaac and Ishmael, followers of Moses and Jesus and Muhammad, find ways to live together in justice and mutual respect. Hasten the day when 'nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore' (Isaiah 2:4). In Your holy Name, Amen/Ameen."*
