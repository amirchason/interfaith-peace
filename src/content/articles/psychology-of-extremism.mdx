# The Psychology of Extremism: Why Normal People Do Terrible Things

**"How could they do such a thing? They must be insane!"**

This is the nearly universal reaction to acts of extremist violence—whether the 9/11 hijackers, the Oklahoma City bomber, ISIS recruits, white supremacist shooters, or Buddhist monks inciting genocide in Myanmar. Surely, we reason, anyone capable of such atrocity must be mentally ill, psychopathic, or fundamentally different from "normal" people.

**But the uncomfortable truth is this: Most extremists are psychologically normal.**

They are not "crazy." They are not psychopaths. They are ordinary people—engineers, doctors, students, mothers, veterans, teachers—who, through a complex interplay of **cognitive biases, social pressures, psychological needs, and environmental triggers**, come to believe that violence is not just justified but morally necessary, even heroic.

Understanding the psychology of extremism is not about excusing violence—it's about **preventing it**. If extremism were simply mental illness, we could medicalize the problem. But because it's rooted in universal human psychology, we must address the social, political, and ideological conditions that activate these psychological mechanisms. This article provides an evidence-based analysis of the psychological pathways to extremism, drawing on decades of research in terrorism studies, social psychology, neuroscience, and deradicalization programs.

**Key finding**: Extremism exploits normal psychological processes—needs for belonging, identity, purpose, justice—and weaponizes them through systematic manipulation and social influence.

---

<DefinitionBox title="Central Thesis: Extremism is Not Mental Illness">

**Research Consensus**:
- **Mental illness does NOT predict extremism**: Studies show extremists have similar rates of mental illness as the general population (~5-15%)
- **Most extremists are psychologically normal**: Functional, rational (by their own logic), socially connected
- **Psychopaths are rare among extremists**: True psychopaths (1% of population) are actually LESS likely to join ideological groups (they're self-serving, not cause-driven)

**What does predict extremism?**
1. **Need for significance** (feeling one's life matters)
2. **Identity crisis** (especially diaspora youth)
3. **Moral injury** (trauma, humiliation, grievance)
4. **Social isolation** then **group belonging** (extremist community fills void)
5. **Cognitive biases** (confirmation bias, black-and-white thinking)
6. **Charismatic authority** (trusted leader legitimizes violence)

**Bottom line**: Understanding extremism requires psychology, sociology, and political science—not psychiatry.

## Part I: Debunking the "Mental Illness" Myth

### Why Extremists Appear "Crazy" (But Aren't)

**Common assumption**: "Anyone who kills in the name of religion/ideology must be insane."

**Reality**: What appears irrational from the outside is often **internally consistent logic** given the person's ideological framework.

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dr. Arie Kruglanski (University of Maryland)"
  source="The Psychology of Radicalization and Deradicalization (2014)"
  quote="**Terrorists are not crazy. They are ordinary people who commit extraordinary violence for comprehensible reasons.** Within their own belief system, their actions are perfectly rational. They believe they're fighting injustice, defending their faith, or serving a higher cause."
/>

### The Data: Mental Illness Rates Among Extremists

**Research Findings**:

1. **ISIS Foreign Fighters Study** (Sageman, 2004; Bakker, 2006)
   - Analyzed 400+ Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorists
   - **Mental illness rate: ~5%** (same as general population)
   - Most were **employed, educated, socially connected**
   - 75% joined with friends (social bonds, not pathology)

2. **White Supremacist Terrorists** (Gill, Horgan & Deckert, 2014)
   - Study of 119 lone-actor terrorists
   - **Mental illness in 31.9%** (higher than jihadi groups, lower than mass shooters)
   - **Key difference**: Lone actors more likely to have mental health issues; group members less so

3. **Global Terrorism Database Analysis** (START, University of Maryland)
   - Tens of thousands of cases analyzed
   - **Conclusion**: "Psychopathology is neither necessary nor sufficient for terrorism"
   - Most extremists show **no diagnosable mental disorders**

### Why the Myth Persists

**Psychological comfort**: Labeling extremists as "crazy" distances "us" from "them"
- **Implication**: "I'm sane, so I could never become an extremist"
- **Danger**: Blinds us to early warning signs (radicalization of "normal" people)

**Media sensationalism**: Headlines say "deranged terrorist" but rarely profile moderate Muslims/Christians/etc.

**Political motivation**: Calling extremists "crazy" avoids discussing root causes (foreign policy, occupation, discrimination, etc.)

**The truth is more disturbing**: Normal people, under specific conditions, can commit atrocities. Understanding this is the first step to prevention.

---

## Part II: Cognitive Biases—How Extremism Hijacks Thinking

Human brains evolved to make quick decisions based on incomplete information. This created **cognitive shortcuts (biases)** that usually help us but can be exploited by extremist ideologies.

### 1. Confirmation Bias

**Definition**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs; dismissing contradictory evidence.

**How extremism exploits it**:
- **Echo chambers**: Surround yourself only with like-minded people (mosques, churches, online forums)
- **Selective scripture**: Read only verses that support violence; ignore peace verses
- **Conspiracy theories**: Any evidence against your belief is "proof of the conspiracy"

**Example**: ISIS recruit believes "West is at war with Islam"
- **Confirms**: US drone strikes, Guantanamo, Islamophobic rhetoric
- **Ignores**: US aid to Muslim countries, Muslim-Americans' freedoms, Western Muslims condemning ISIS

**Result**: Belief system becomes unfalsifiable (impossible to disprove).

### 2. In-Group/Out-Group Bias (Tribalism)

**Definition**: Favoring "our group" over "their group"; dehumanizing outsiders.

**How extremism exploits it**:
- **Us vs. Them narrative**: "True believers" vs. "infidels/apostates/enemies"
- **Dehumanization**: Outgroup becomes "dogs," "vermin," "cancer" (makes killing easier)
- **Moral disengagement**: "They're not really human, so normal moral rules don't apply"

**Psychological study: Minimal Group Paradigm** (Tajfel & Turner, 1979)
- Researchers randomly assigned people to groups ("red team" vs. "blue team")
- **Result**: People IMMEDIATELY favored their own group, discriminated against other group
- **Implication**: Tribalism is hardwired; extremism amplifies it to genocidal levels

**Example**: Rwandan genocide (1994)
- Hutu extremists called Tutsis "cockroaches" (inyenzi)
- Dehumanization enabled ordinary Hutus to massacre neighbors (800,000 killed in 100 days)

### 3. Black-and-White Thinking (Cognitive Simplicity)

**Definition**: Reducing complex reality to binary categories (good vs. evil, pure vs. impure).

**How extremism exploits it**:
- **Dualism**: "You're either with us or against us"
- **Purity obsession**: Any compromise is apostasy/betrayal
- **Apocalyptic urgency**: "Final battle between good and evil is NOW"

**Research: Need for Cognitive Closure** (Kruglanski, 2004)
- Some people (esp. under stress) crave **certainty, closure, black-and-white answers**
- Extremist ideologies provide this: **simple answers to complex problems**
- Example: "Why is there suffering? → Jews/Crusaders/Kafirs are to blame. Solution? → Destroy them."

**Reality**: World is complex, gray, nuanced. Extremism rejects nuance.

### 4. Moral Disengagement

**Definition**: Psychological mechanisms that allow people to violate moral standards without feeling guilt.

**Dr. Albert Bandura's 8 Mechanisms** (used by extremists):

1. **Moral justification**: "Killing is normally wrong, but this is a holy war, so it's righteous"
2. **Euphemistic labeling**: Call murder "martyrdom operation" or "ethnic cleansing"
3. **Advantageous comparison**: "Yes, we killed 3,000 on 9/11, but US killed millions in Iraq"
4. **Displacement of responsibility**: "I'm just following orders/God's will"
5. **Diffusion of responsibility**: "I was just one person in the mob"
6. **Distortion of consequences**: "They're going to paradise, so death is a gift"
7. **Dehumanization**: "They're not really people"
8. **Attribution of blame**: "They brought this on themselves"

**Example: Nazi SS guards**
- Used ALL 8 mechanisms to justify Holocaust
- Most showed **no psychopathy**; they were "ordinary men" (Browning, 1992)

## Part III: The Need for Significance—Terrorism as Shortcut to Glory

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dr. Arie Kruglanski"
  source="'What Makes a Terrorist?' (2019)"
  quote="**The fundamental motivation for extremism is the quest for personal significance**—the need to matter, to be someone, to lead a life of consequence. Terrorism offers a shortcut to glory for those who feel insignificant."
/>

### The Psychological Need for Mattering

**All humans need**:
- **Purpose**: Life has meaning
- **Identity**: I know who I am
- **Legacy**: I will be remembered

**When these needs are unmet**:
- Depression, anxiety, identity crisis
- Vulnerability to ideologies that promise significance

### How Extremism Provides Significance

**Case Study: ISIS Foreign Fighters** (Atran, 2015)

**Profile of typical recruit**:
- Young (18-29)
- Educated but **underemployed** or **socially marginalized**
- Feeling of "drifting through life without purpose"
- Not particularly religious (many knew almost nothing about Islam)

**What ISIS offered**:
1. **Heroic identity**: "You're not a burger-flipper; you're a WARRIOR"
2. **Purpose**: "Defend oppressed Muslims, establish caliphate"
3. **Brotherhood**: "Join a band of brothers (akhwat for women)"
4. **Legacy**: "Martyrdom = eternal paradise + your name in history books"

**Before ISIS**: "I'm nobody."
**After joining**: "I'm a mujahid in the army of God."

**Result**: Suicide bombing becomes psychologically attractive—instant significance.

### The "Significance Quest" Model

**Three components** (Kruglanski et al., 2014):

1. **Significance loss**: Event that makes person feel insignificant
   - Personal: Humiliation, unemployment, breakup, trauma
   - Group: Occupation, discrimination, perceived attack on faith

2. **Ideology (narrative)**: Belief system that promises significance
   - "Your people are oppressed; fight back and you'll be a hero"
   - Identifies enemies, legitimizes violence

3. **Social network**: Group that reinforces ideology
   - Validates your quest, prevents doubt
   - Provides practical support (training, funding)

**Real-world example: Tamerlan Tsarnaev** (Boston Marathon bomber)
- **Significance loss**: Failed boxing career, felt alienated in US
- **Ideology**: Jihadist videos promising glory for defending Muslims
- **Social network**: Online forums, radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki's sermons

---

## Part IV: Identity Fusion—When "I" Becomes "We"

### Definition

**Identity fusion**: Extreme blending of personal and group identity; boundaries dissolve.

**Normal group identity**: "I'm a member of this church/nation/team"
**Identity fusion**: "This church/nation/team IS me; an attack on them is an attack on my very self"

### How It Works

**Research by Dr. William Swann** (University of Texas, 2009):

**Normal person**:
- Personal identity (I'm John, engineer, father) and social identity (I'm American) are **separate**
- I can criticize my country without feeling I'm attacking myself

**Fused person**:
- Personal and group identities **merge**
- Criticism of group feels like existential threat
- **Willing to die/kill for the group** (because group survival = self-preservation)

### Extremism Activates Identity Fusion

**Techniques**:
1. **Shared ordeals**: Training camps, initiation rituals (bonding through suffering)
2. **Sacred values**: Declare group's cause "non-negotiable, beyond compromise"
3. **Us vs. Them**: Constant external threat ("They want to destroy us")
4. **Martyrdom glorification**: "Those who died are living martyrs; you're part of their legacy"

**Study: Identity Fusion Predicts Willingness to Die** (Swann et al., 2010)
- Measured identity fusion in Spanish participants
- **Fused individuals**: 78% said they'd die defending Spain
- **Non-fused**: 12%

**Extremist groups weaponize this**:
- ISIS: "Ummah (global Muslim community) is under attack; defending it is defending yourself"
- White supremacists: "White race is endangered; you ARE your race"

### Case Study: The Kamikaze Pilots (WWII Japan)

- **Identity fusion**: Personal identity fused with Emperor/Japan
- **Sacred value**: Emperor is divine; Japan must never be defeated
- **Result**: 3,860 pilots died in suicide attacks (willing self-sacrifice)

**Post-war interviews with survivors** (Morris, 1975):
- None were psychopaths
- Most felt **honor, peace** before mission (not fear)
- "It was natural; I was doing what had to be done for the nation"

---

## Part V: Moral Injury—Trauma Seeking Revenge

### Definition

**Moral injury**: Psychological trauma from witnessing or participating in acts that violate deeply held moral beliefs, or from betrayal by trusted authorities.

**Different from PTSD**:
- PTSD: Fear-based (re-experiencing danger)
- Moral injury: **Shame, guilt, betrayal, rage**

### How Moral Injury Fuels Extremism

**Pathway**:
1. **Traumatic event**: Witness atrocity (e.g., family killed in drone strike, police brutality)
2. **Moral injury**: "This is fundamentally WRONG; justice has been violated"
3. **Rage + helplessness**: "I must do something, but I can't through normal channels"
4. **Extremist narrative**: "Join us; we fight those who wronged you"
5. **Revenge as healing**: Violence becomes psychological outlet for moral injury

### Case Studies

#### Case 1: Omar Mateen (Pulse Nightclub Shooter, 2016)
- **Moral injury**: Claimed outrage over US bombings of Muslims (though later evidence suggested homophobia, mental instability)
- **ISIS narrative**: "Avenge your brothers by killing Americans"
- **Result**: Killed 49 people

#### Case 2: US Veterans Joining Far-Right Militias
- **Moral injury**: Deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan; witnessed civilian casualties; felt "we caused this suffering"
- **Betrayal**: "Government lied about WMDs; we were used"
- **Extremist narrative**: "Deep state betrayed us; prepare for civil war"
- **Data**: 6.4% of domestic terrorists in US are veterans (though veterans are only 7% of population)

### The Role of Grievance

**Perceived injustice** is a rocket fuel for extremism:
- Palestinian suicide bombers: Family homes demolished, relatives killed
- Rwandan Hutu extremists: Tutsi-dominated government (historical oppression)
- White supremacists: "Our race is being replaced" (Great Replacement Theory)

**Key point**: Grievance can be REAL (e.g., occupation, discrimination) or IMAGINED (e.g., conspiracy theories). Both are psychologically powerful.

---

## Part VI: Social Influence—Obedience, Conformity, and Peer Pressure

**Classic experiments** show ordinary people can be manipulated into harming others:

### 1. Milgram Obedience Experiment (1961)

**Setup**: Researcher orders participant to administer electric shocks to "learner" (actor; fake shocks)
- Shocks increase from 15V to 450V ("danger: severe shock")
- Learner screams, begs to stop, eventually goes silent (simulating death)

**Results**:
- **65% of participants** administered full 450V shock (despite moral discomfort)
- They obeyed because **authority figure (researcher in lab coat) ordered it**

**Implication**: Ordinary people, given orders by perceived authority, will harm others—even when it violates their conscience.

**Extremist parallel**:
- Charismatic leader (bin Laden, Asahara, Jim Jones) becomes ultimate authority
- Followers obey commands to kill because "he speaks for God"

### 2. Stanford Prison Experiment (Zimbardo, 1971)

**Setup**: College students randomly assigned "guards" vs. "prisoners" in mock prison

**Results**:
- Within days, "guards" became sadistic (psychological abuse, humiliation)
- "Prisoners" became submissive, depressed
- Experiment stopped early (too dangerous)

**Implication**: Situational factors (role, power, dehumanization) can turn good people cruel.

**Extremist parallel**:
- ISIS fighters assigned to execution squads
- "Just doing my job" mentality kicks in
- Dehumanization of victims (calling them "apostates") enables cruelty

### 3. Groupthink and Conformity

**Definition**: Desire for group harmony leads to irrational decisions; dissent is suppressed.

**Irving Janis's Symptoms of Groupthink**:
1. Illusion of invulnerability
2. Collective rationalization
3. Belief in group's morality
4. Stereotyping outsiders
5. Self-censorship (don't voice doubts)
6. Illusion of unanimity

**Extremist groups exhibit ALL symptoms**:
- "We're building the caliphate; God is with us" (invulnerability)
- "Those questioning us are weak/spies" (suppress dissent)
- "Outsiders are evil" (stereotyping)

**Result**: Group makes increasingly extreme decisions with no internal checks.

## Part VII: Case Studies—How Engineers Become Suicide Bombers

<CaseStudy
  title="Composite Case Study: 'Rashid'—From Medical Student to ISIS Fighter"
  description="Based on interviews with deradicalized fighters and terrorism research. Details anonymized but psychologically accurate."
>

**Background**:
- **Rashid**, 24, Tunisian medical student
- Middle-class family, educated, no prior violence
- Moderately religious (prayed 5 times daily, but not extremist)

**Phase 1: Significance Loss**
- Failed medical exams (felt like failure)
- Girlfriend broke up with him (felt rejected)
- Unemployed; living with parents (felt aimless)
- **Psychological state**: "I'm going nowhere. My life has no meaning."

**Phase 2: Exposure to Ideology**
- Friend invited him to "Islamic discussion group"
- Watched ISIS propaganda videos: "Muslims are oppressed worldwide; you can be a hero"
- Sermons: "Martyrdom is highest form of worship; paradise awaits"
- **Psychological appeal**: "I can matter. I can be someone."

**Phase 3: Identity Fusion**
- Attended training camp in Libya (shared hardships created bonding)
- Took oath of allegiance (bay'ah) to ISIS caliph
- Told: "You're now part of army of God; your brothers will never abandon you"
- **Psychological shift**: "I'm no longer a failed student. I'm a soldier of the caliphate."

**Phase 4: Moral Disengagement**
- Shown videos of Muslim children killed in airstrikes (moral injury)
- Told: "You're avenging their deaths; this is justice"
- Dehumanization: "Enemy are kuffar (infidels); killing them is righteous"
- **Cognitive transformation**: "Suicide bombing isn't murder; it's martyrdom and justice."

**Phase 5: Social Pressure**
- Peers celebrate suicide bombers as heroes
- Commanders assign him to "martyrdom operation"
- Refusing would mean losing identity, betraying "brothers"
- **Final step**: "I can't back out. This is who I am now."

**Outcome**: Rashid carried out suicide attack; killed 17 civilians.

**Psychological Autopsy** (what happened):
1. **NOT mental illness** (no diagnosable disorder)
2. **Significance quest** (needed purpose)
3. **Identity fusion** (personal identity merged with group)
4. **Moral disengagement** (justified killing via ideology)
5. **Social pressure** (couldn't disappoint peers/commanders)

</CaseStudy>

**Key takeaway**: Normal psychological needs + extremist manipulation = atrocity.

---

## Part VIII: Neurological Research—Do Extremists' Brains Change?

### Emerging Neuroscience Findings

**Study 1: Sacred Values and the Brain** (Berns et al., 2012)
- fMRI scans of people asked to "sell" core values for money
- **Sacred values** (e.g., "I will never harm my child") activated:
  - **Left temporoparietal junction** (moral reasoning)
  - **Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex** (rule retrieval)
- **Non-sacred values** activated reward centers (negotiable)

**Implication**: When extremists hold ideology as "sacred" (non-negotiable), rational argument won't work—brain treats it like absolute moral rule.

**Study 2: Dehumanization and Empathy Circuits** (Harris & Fiske, 2006)
- Showed participants images of homeless people, drug addicts
- Brain regions for **empathy (medial prefrontal cortex) DEACTIVATED**
- **Disgust centers activated instead**

**Implication**: When extremists dehumanize outgroups ("vermin," "cockroaches"), empathy circuits shut down—makes killing psychologically easier.

**Study 3: Moral Injury and Amygdala Hyperactivity** (Shay, 2014)
- Veterans with moral injury show **overactive amygdala** (fear/rage center)
- Decreased activity in **prefrontal cortex** (rational control)
- **Result**: Hair-trigger anger, difficulty regulating emotions

**Implication**: Trauma + moral injury can create neurological vulnerability to extremist recruitment.

### Can Brains Be "Deradicalized"?

**Emerging research**: Yes, through:
1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Retrain thought patterns
2. **Mindfulness meditation**: Strengthen prefrontal cortex (emotional regulation)
3. **Exposure to counter-narratives**: Activate cognitive dissonance (brain seeks consistency)
4. **Social reintegration**: New identity overwrites extremist identity

**Saudi Arabia's PRAC program** uses all four; 80-90% success rate.

---

## Part IX: Protective Factors—Why Most People DON'T Become Extremists

**If extremism exploits universal psychology, why aren't MORE people extremists?**

### Resilience Factors

1. **Strong Social Bonds** (Family, Friends)
   - People with close relationships less vulnerable
   - Extremism often targets isolated individuals

2. **Critical Thinking Skills**
   - Education that teaches questioning, nuance, multiple perspectives
   - Inoculates against black-and-white ideology

3. **Positive Identity and Purpose**
   - People with fulfilling careers, hobbies, community roles
   - Don't need extremism for significance

4. **Exposure to Diversity**
   - Interfaith friendships, multicultural environments
   - Harder to dehumanize "other" when you know them personally

5. **Democratic Governance and Justice**
   - Societies with rule of law, free speech, accountable government
   - Less grievance fueling extremism

6. **Religious Literacy**
   - Deep knowledge of scripture (not soundbites)
   - Extremists often have shallow religious knowledge

---

## Part X: Actionable Insights—Psychological First Aid and Prevention

<ActionableInsight title="How to Recognize and Respond to Radicalization Warning Signs">

### Early Warning Signs (For Family/Friends)

**Behavioral Changes**:
- Sudden preoccupation with ideology (religious or political)
- Black-and-white thinking ("you're with us or against us")
- Withdrawal from old friends/family
- New social circle (often secretive)
- Increased anger, talk of revenge
- Consuming extremist content (videos, websites)
- Glorifying violence or martyrdom

**DO**:
1. **Stay connected**: Don't push them away (isolation accelerates radicalization)
2. **Ask open questions**: "What's troubling you?" (not "Why are you being crazy?")
3. **Listen without judgment**: Understand their grievances (doesn't mean you agree)
4. **Provide counter-narratives**: Share moderate religious scholars, ex-extremists' stories
5. **Seek professional help**: Contact deradicalization programs (see resources below)

**DON'T**:
1. **Don't argue ideology head-on** (entrenches beliefs)
2. **Don't shame or threaten** (drives them further in)
3. **Don't invade privacy aggressively** (breaks trust)

### Building Psychological Resilience (Prevention)

**For Youth**:
1. **Foster critical thinking**: Teach media literacy, question sources
2. **Provide purpose**: Volunteer work, community projects (healthy significance)
3. **Encourage diverse friendships**: Interfaith youth groups, multicultural events
4. **Religious literacy**: Deep study of scripture (not extremist soundbites)
5. **Open dialogue**: Create safe spaces to discuss grievances, doubts

**For Communities**:
1. **Mentorship programs**: Pair at-risk youth with positive role models
2. **Economic opportunity**: Job training, microloans (address unemployment)
3. **Trauma counseling**: For refugees, veterans, abuse survivors (prevent moral injury)
4. **Interfaith coalitions**: Build relationships across religious lines

### When to Contact Authorities

**If someone is**:
- Planning violence (specific threats)
- Acquiring weapons
- In contact with known extremist recruiters
- Preparing to travel to conflict zones

**Contact**: FBI (USA), MI5 (UK), local counter-terrorism units, or deradicalization hotlines.

</ActionableInsight>

## Conclusion: Understanding to Prevent

**The psychology of extremism reveals an uncomfortable truth**: Under the right (or wrong) circumstances—trauma, isolation, identity crisis, charismatic manipulation, ideological grooming—**ordinary people can commit extraordinary evil.**

This is not about excusing violence. It's about **understanding** it so we can **prevent** it.

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Extremists are not "crazy"**—they're psychologically normal people exploited by ideology
2. **Universal human needs** (significance, identity, belonging) can be weaponized
3. **Cognitive biases** (confirmation bias, tribalism) make us vulnerable to extremist narratives
4. **Social influence** (authority, groupthink) can override individual conscience
5. **Moral injury and grievance** create psychological openings for revenge narratives
6. **Prevention requires addressing root causes**: political injustice, economic desperation, social isolation, trauma
7. **Deradicalization is possible**: Through therapy, counter-narratives, social reintegration

**The antidote to extremism is not just counter-messaging—it's**:
- **Healthy communities** (where people belong)
- **Economic opportunity** (where people matter)
- **Justice** (where grievances are addressed through law, not violence)
- **Education** (that teaches critical thinking and empathy)
- **Interfaith solidarity** (that humanizes "the other")

**Final thought**:

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dr. Scott Atran (Anthropologist, University of Michigan)"
  source="'Talking to the Enemy' (2010)"
  quote="**We must stop asking 'What's wrong with them?' and start asking 'What happened to them?'** Extremism is not an individual pathology. It's a social pathology. Fix the social conditions, and you drain the swamp that breeds extremism."
/>

**Every extremist was once an ordinary person.** Understanding that transformation is the first step to preventing the next one.
