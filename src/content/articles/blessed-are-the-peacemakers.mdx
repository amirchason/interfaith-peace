# Blessed Are the Peacemakers: What Matthew 5:9 Really Means

<VerseCard
  greek="μακάριοι οἱ εἰρηνοποιοί, ὅτι αὐτοὶ υἱοὶ θεοῦ κληθήσονται"
  transliteration="Makarioi hoi eirēnopoioi, hoti autoi huioi theou klēthēsontai"
  translation="**Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.**"
  reference="Matthew 5:9"
  theme="Divine Calling of Peacemaking"
/>

This single verse—**Matthew 5:9**, nestled in the heart of Jesus's Beatitudes—contains one of Christianity's most radical claims: **Peacemaking is not optional for Christians but definitional.** To be a child of God is to make peace. To make peace is to reflect God's own nature.

Yet "peacemaker" has been misunderstood, sentimentalized, and even weaponized. Some reduce it to "be nice" or "avoid conflict." Others use it to silence prophetic voices demanding justice. Still others cherry-pick this verse while ignoring Jesus's harsher sayings ("I came not to bring peace, but a sword," Matthew 10:34—more on this paradox later).

This comprehensive guide unpacks Matthew 5:9 word-by-word in its original Greek, explores its theological depth, examines how peacemakers from St. Francis to Martin Luther King Jr. lived it out, and provides practical tools for Christian peacemaking today.

<QuickAnswer title="What Does 'Blessed Are the Peacemakers' Mean?">

**Matthew 5:9** means:

1. **"Blessed" (μακάριοι, *makarioi*)**: **Happy, fortunate, spiritually prosperous**—not just "congratulations" but a state of deep joy from living in alignment with God's kingdom
2. **"Peacemakers" (εἰρηνοποιοί, *eirēnopoioi*)**: **Active creators of peace**—not passive peacekeepers, but those who **make** (*poieō*) peace where conflict exists
3. **"Children of God" (υἱοὶ θεοῦ, *huioi theou*)**: **Family resemblance to God**—peacemakers reflect God's nature because God is fundamentally a peacemaker (reconciling humanity through Christ)

**Core Message**: **Peacemaking is divine work.** When you create peace—reconcile enemies, heal divisions, build bridges—you're doing what God does. This makes you recognizable as God's child.

**Not Saying**: "Avoid all conflict" or "Be silent about injustice." Jesus himself confronted evil boldly (cleansing temple, calling Pharisees "whitewashed tombs"). **Biblical peace = shalom = justice + harmony + wholeness**, not mere absence of tension.

</QuickAnswer>

## Part I: Word Study — What "Peacemaker" Really Means

### 1. "Blessed" (μακάριοι, *Makarioi*) — More Than "Happy"

<GreekWord
  word="μακάριοι"
  transliteration="makarioi"
  meaning="Blessed, happy, fortunate, spiritually prosperous"
  root="μάκαρ (makar) = blessed one, typically used for gods"
/>

**Old Testament Background**: Hebrew **אַשְׁרֵי** (*ashrei*) in Psalms—"Happy/blessed is the one who..." (Psalm 1:1, 32:1, 119:1)

**Meaning**: **Not superficial happiness** (feeling good momentarily) but **deep flourishing**—the state of those living in God's kingdom, aligned with reality.

**Paradox**: Jesus pronounces "blessed" people the world calls **cursed**:
- Poor in spirit (5:3)
- Mourning (5:4)
- Meek (5:5)
- Persecuted (5:10)

**Implication**: **True blessedness comes from living God's upside-down kingdom**, not world's values. Peacemakers may **suffer** for peacemaking (5:11-12), yet they are blessed.

### 2. "Peacemakers" (εἰρηνοποιοί, *Eirēnopoioi*) — Active Agents

<GreekWord
  word="εἰρηνοποιοί"
  transliteration="eirēnopoioi"
  meaning="Peacemakers, peace-creators, peace-builders"
  root="εἰρήνη (eirēnē, peace) + ποιέω (poieō, to make, create, do)"
/>

**Key Insight**: **Not** *eirēnē* (peace, noun) or *eirēnikos* (peaceful, adjective) but **eirēno-poioi** (peace-**makers**, active participle).

**This is a verb**: You **do** peacemaking. It requires **effort, skill, sacrifice**.

**Contrast**:
- **Peacekeepers**: Maintain existing peace (passive)
- **Peace-lovers**: Appreciate peace (sentiment)
- **Peacemakers**: **Create** peace where it doesn't exist (active)

**Three Dimensions of Peacemaking**:

1. **Personal**: Reconciling broken relationships (Matthew 5:23-24: "Leave your gift...first be reconciled")
2. **Social**: Mediating conflicts between groups/communities
3. **Systemic**: Addressing root causes of violence (poverty, injustice, oppression)

**Biblical Parallel**: **God is the Ultimate Peacemaker**

<VerseCard
  translation="**For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things**, whether on earth or in heaven, **by making peace through the blood of his cross**."
  reference="Colossians 1:19-20"
  theme="God the Peacemaker"
/>

**Theological Point**: **Peacemaking is imitatio Dei** (imitation of God). God made peace (humanity reconciled to God through Christ's sacrifice); we make peace (reconciling people to each other).

### 3. "Children of God" (υἱοὶ θεοῦ, *Huioi Theou*) — Family Resemblance

<GreekWord
  word="υἱοὶ θεοῦ"
  transliteration="huioi theou"
  meaning="Sons/children of God"
  note="Inclusive of all genders in NT usage"
/>

**Two Meanings**:

**1. Identity**: Who you **are** (God's child by adoption/grace)
**2. Recognition**: Who people **see** you to be (your actions reveal your parentage)

**In Matthew 5:9, it's meaning #2**: When you make peace, people will **recognize** you as God's child—**family resemblance** is unmistakable.

**How is God a Peacemaker?**

- **Creator of shalom**: Genesis 1—original creation was harmonious ("very good")
- **Reconciler**: The entire gospel narrative is God reconciling rebellious humanity to Himself
- **Prince of Peace**: Jesus called "Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6)—His mission was making peace (vertical: God-human; horizontal: human-human)

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dr. Scot McKnight"
  source="The Sermon on the Mount (2013)"
  quote="**To be called 'sons of God' in Matthew 5:9 is not about getting into heaven—it's about doing the family business.** God's business is peacemaking. If you're in the family, you're in the business. Peacemakers prove their kinship to the God of peace."
/>

**Roman Context**: In Jesus's day, **Caesar** was called "son of god" (*divi filius*) who brought *Pax Romana* (peace through military conquest).

**Jesus subverts this**: True "sons of God" bring peace through **love, not swords**—radically different kingdom.

---

## Part II: The Beatitudes' Progression Toward Peacemaking

### 4. The Seven Beatitudes Before "Peacemakers"

**The Beatitudes aren't random**—they build toward peacemaking:

1. **Blessed are the poor in spirit** (5:3): **Humility**—recognizing you don't have all answers; essential for listening to "enemy"
2. **Blessed are those who mourn** (5:4): **Empathy**—feeling others' pain; can't make peace without compassion
3. **Blessed are the meek** (5:5): **Controlled strength**—power used gently, not violently
4. **Blessed are those who hunger for justice** (5:6): **Justice-seeking**—peace requires righteousness, not just cessation of fighting
5. **Blessed are the merciful** (5:7): **Forgiveness**—breaking cycles of revenge
6. **Blessed are the pure in heart** (5:8): **Integrity**—peacemaking requires honest motives, not manipulation
7. **Blessed are the peacemakers** (5:9): **Culmination**—all previous beatitudes converge in peacemaking

**Then**:
8. **Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness** (5:10): **Cost**—true peacemaking will provoke hostility from those profiting from conflict

**Progression**: You can't be a peacemaker (5:9) without humility (5:3), empathy (5:4), mercy (5:7), and justice (5:6). And if you do it authentically, expect persecution (5:10).

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dietrich Bonhoeffer"
  source="The Cost of Discipleship (1937)"
  quote="**The peacemakers will carry the cross with their Lord**, for it was on the cross that peace was made. Being **children of God** means being like Christ, and that entails suffering."
/>

## Part III: Biblical Theology of Peacemaking

### 5. Jesus the Peacemaker: Model for Disciples

**Jesus's entire ministry was peacemaking**:

**1. Reconciling God and Humanity** (Vertical Peace):

<VerseCard
  translation="**For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son**, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life."
  reference="Romans 5:10"
  theme="Reconciliation"
/>

**2. Breaking Down Barriers** (Horizontal Peace):

<VerseCard
  translation="**For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall**, that is, the hostility between us."
  reference="Ephesians 2:14"
  theme="Unity"
/>

**Context**: Jews and Gentiles (ancient enemies) reconciled through Christ.

**3. Teaching Nonviolent Resistance**:
- **Turn the other cheek** (Matthew 5:39): Refuse to mirror aggressor's violence
- **Love your enemies** (Matthew 5:44): Extend goodwill even to oppressors
- **Go the extra mile** (Matthew 5:41): Subvert unjust systems through creative non-cooperation

**4. Cleansing the Temple** (Matthew 21:12-13):

**Wait—isn't Jesus violent here?**

<VerseCard
  translation="**Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables** of the money changers."
  reference="Matthew 21:12"
  theme="Prophetic Action"
/>

**Important**: Jesus:
- **Overturned tables** (property)
- **Did NOT harm people** (no violence against persons)
- **Prophetic act**: Exposing corruption, not revenge

**Lesson**: **Peace ≠ passivity**. Jesus confronted evil loudly, but didn't injure people.

### 6. Paradox: "I Came to Bring a Sword"?

<VerseCard
  translation="**Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.**"
  reference="Matthew 10:34"
  theme="Division"
/>

**Contradiction with "Blessed are peacemakers"?** No.

**Explanation**:
- **Matthew 10:34**: Jesus predicts that **following him will cause division** (families split over faith, etc.)
- **Matthew 5:9**: Jesus commands **his followers to make peace** (reconcile conflicts)

**Two different things**:
1. **Jesus's mission** may cause division (people reject him)
2. **Jesus's disciples** must still make peace (reconcile where possible)

**Analogy**: A doctor's treatment (chemotherapy) may cause short-term pain, but the goal is healing. Jesus's truth exposes evil, causing conflict, but the **ultimate goal is peace through transformation**.

## Part IV: Historical Peacemakers — Living Matthew 5:9

### 7. St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) — Peace in the Crusades

<HistoricalExample>

**Background**: Italian nobleman who renounced wealth to follow Christ radically

**Peacemaking Act**: During **Fifth Crusade** (1219), Francis crossed battle lines to meet **Sultan Malik al-Kamil** of Egypt

**Astonishing**: Christians and Muslims were slaughtering each other; Francis walked into Muslim camp **unarmed**, offering dialogue

**Outcome**:
- Sultan spared Francis (impressed by his courage and humility)
- No conversions, but **mutual respect**
- Francis returned to Christian camp advocating for peace

**Quote** (attributed): "**Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words.**"

**Famous Prayer**: "Lord, make me an instrument of your peace..."

**Legacy**: Franciscan Order continues peace work globally (interfaith dialogue, conflict mediation).

</HistoricalExample>

**Why This Embodies Matthew 5:9**:
- Francis **actively crossed** enemy lines (made peace, didn't wait for it)
- Reflected God's nature (approaching enemy with love, not violence)
- Demonstrated "blessed are peacemakers" in most violent context (Crusades)

### 8. Dorothy Day (1897-1980) — Catholic Worker Movement

<HistoricalExample>

**Background**: Journalist, socialist, converted to Catholicism

**Peacemaking Work**: Founded **Catholic Worker Movement** (1933)—houses of hospitality for poor, homeless; radical pacifism

**Stance**: **Absolute pacifism**
- Refused to support WWII (controversial—Nazi evil was real)
- Opposed Vietnam War, nuclear weapons
- Advocated nonviolent resistance

**Quote**: "**I really only love God as much as I love the person I love the least.**" (Echoing Matthew 5:9 + 5:44)

**Activism**:
- Arrested multiple times for protesting wars
- Civil disobedience (draft resistance)
- Daily service to poor (lived in poverty herself)

**Legacy**: 200+ Catholic Worker houses worldwide still operating.

</HistoricalExample>

**Why This Embodies Matthew 5:9**:
- Day made peace through **serving enemies** (the poor, the despised)
- Combined **personal holiness** (daily prayer) with **social action** (protest, service)
- Suffered persecution (arrests, criticism) for righteousness (5:10)

### 9. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) — Nonviolent Resistance

<HistoricalExample>

**Background**: Baptist minister, leader of Civil Rights Movement

**Peacemaking Theology**: **Beloved Community**—vision of society based on justice, love, reconciliation

**Method**: **Nonviolent direct action** (sit-ins, marches, boycotts)—inspired by Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and Gandhi's satyagraha

**Key Teaching**: "**Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.**" (Pure Dhammapada 1:5 + Matthew 5:9)

**Achievements**:
- Civil Rights Act (1964)
- Voting Rights Act (1965)
- Dismantled legal segregation **without armed revolution**

**Assassination**: Killed for peacemaking (ultimate "persecuted for righteousness," Matthew 5:10)

**Quote**: "**True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.**"

</HistoricalExample>

**Why This Embodies Matthew 5:9**:
- MLK **made peace** by addressing root causes (racism, economic injustice)
- Loved enemies (prayed for segregationists, opposed killing even in self-defense)
- Called peacemaker yet faced persecution (fulfilling both 5:9 and 5:10)

### 10. Desmond Tutu (1931-2021) — Truth and Reconciliation

<HistoricalExample>

**Background**: South African Anglican Archbishop, anti-apartheid activist

**Peacemaking Work**: Chaired **Truth and Reconciliation Commission** (1996-1998) after apartheid ended

**Revolutionary Approach**: **Restorative justice**, not retributive
- Victims confronted perpetrators
- Perpetrators confessed crimes
- Forgiveness offered (not demanded)
- **Goal**: National healing, not revenge

**Ubuntu Philosophy**: "I am because we are"—interconnectedness of humanity (echoing Matthew 5:9's "family of God")

**Quote**: "**Without forgiveness, there is no future.**"

**Legacy**: Model for post-conflict reconciliation (Rwanda, Sierra Leone, etc.)

</HistoricalExample>

**Why This Embodies Matthew 5:9**:
- Tutu **created peace** through **truth + forgiveness** (not denying evil, but transcending it)
- Reflected God's peacemaking (God confronts sin honestly, then offers grace)
- Built "family of God" across racial divide (black and white South Africans reconciling)

---

## Part V: Practical Peacemaking Today

### 11. Three Levels of Christian Peacemaking

**1. Personal Peacemaking** (Interpersonal Reconciliation):

<VerseCard
  translation="**So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there** before the altar and go; first **be reconciled to your brother or sister**, and then come and offer your gift."
  reference="Matthew 5:23-24"
  theme="Reconciliation Before Worship"
/>

**Radical**: Jesus says **stop worshiping** if you have unreconciled conflict. Reconciliation is more urgent than ritual.

**Practical Steps**:
1. **Take initiative**: Don't wait for other to apologize—you go first
2. **Listen deeply**: "I want to understand how I hurt you"
3. **Own your part**: Even if 10% your fault, acknowledge that 10%
4. **Forgive**: Release resentment (doesn't mean trust immediately, but release bitterness)
5. **Rebuild**: Reconciliation is process, not one conversation

**2. Community Peacemaking** (Mediation, Conflict Resolution):

<VerseCard
  translation="**If another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when the two of you are alone**... But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along... **If the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church**."
  reference="Matthew 18:15-17"
  theme="Church Discipline / Mediation"
/>

**Process**:
1. **One-on-one**: Private conversation first
2. **Small group mediation**: If unresolved, bring witnesses/mediators
3. **Community involvement**: If still unresolved, involve church leadership

**Modern Application**: Church conflict resolution teams, trained mediators

**3. Systemic Peacemaking** (Justice, Advocacy, Structural Change):

**Jesus's Teaching**: "**Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness**" (Matthew 5:6)

**Prophetic Tradition** (Jesus inherits from OT prophets):

<VerseCard
  translation="**Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free**, and to break every yoke?"
  reference="Isaiah 58:6"
  theme="Justice as Worship"
/>

**Practical Steps**:
- **Identify injustice**: Where do systems harm people? (mass incarceration, economic inequality, environmental racism)
- **Educate yourself**: Learn from those directly affected
- **Advocate**: Write legislators, support policy reform
- **Organize**: Join or form groups (Christians for Social Action, Sojourners, Evangelicals for Peace)
- **Civil disobedience** (if appropriate): MLK, Dorothy Day model—breaking unjust laws nonviolently

---

## Part VI: Common Mistakes in Peacemaking

### 12. False Peace vs. True Peace

**False Peace** (שקט, *sheket* in Hebrew = "quietness" but not *shalom*):

**1. "Peace at Any Cost"** (Appeasing Evil):
- **Chamberlain's Munich Agreement** (1938): Appeased Hitler to avoid war—evil grew stronger
- **Abusive relationships**: "Keep peace" by tolerating abuse
- **Injustice tolerated**: Silence about oppression to avoid conflict

<ScholarQuote
  scholar="Dietrich Bonhoeffer"
  source="Ethics (1942)"
  quote="**Silence in the face of evil is itself evil.** God will not hold us guiltless. **Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.**"
/>

**2. "Nice" Peacemaking** (Conflict Avoidance):
- Avoiding all confrontation
- Never naming evil
- Pretending problems don't exist

**Jesus was NOT "nice"**:
- Called Pharisees "**hypocrites**," "**blind guides**," "**whitewashed tombs**" (Matthew 23)
- Cleansed temple (Matthew 21)
- Challenged unjust Sabbath rules (Mark 2-3)

**True Peace** (*Shalom*):

**1. Peace WITH Justice**:
- MLK: "**True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.**"
- Can't have shalom while oppression continues

**2. Peace Through Truth**:
- **Truth and Reconciliation** model (Tutu)—can't reconcile without acknowledging truth
- Jesus: "**You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free**" (John 8:32)

**3. Peace That Costs**:
- **Bonhoeffer**: "**Cheap grace**" = forgiveness without repentance. **Costly grace** = transformation
- Peacemaking requires **sacrifice** (time, comfort, sometimes life—Jesus, MLK, etc.)

## Part VII: Practical Tools for Peacemakers

### 13. 10 Daily Practices of Christian Peacemakers

<ActionableInsight>

**1. Morning Prayer for Enemies**:
- **"Bless those who curse you" (Luke 6:28)**
- Each morning, pray by name for someone you dislike/disagree with
- Ask God to bless them, not change them to agree with you

**2. Scripture Meditation on Peace**:
- Daily read one peace verse (Matthew 5-7, Romans 12, James 3)
- Memorize key verses (Matthew 5:9, Romans 12:18)

**3. Examine Conscience**:
- **Evening reflection**: "Where did I create conflict today? Where did I make peace?"
- **Confess** harm done, **celebrate** peacemaking

**4. Practice Active Listening**:
- **When someone angers you**: Pause, breathe, ask: "Tell me more. Help me understand."
- **Seek first to understand, then to be understood** (St. Francis)

**5. Conflict Check-In** (Weekly):
- **Ask yourself**: "Is there anyone I'm avoiding because of conflict?"
- **Matthew 5:23-24**: Reach out this week to reconcile

**6. Study Nonviolent History**:
- Read books: *Jesus and Nonviolence* (Walter Wink), *Strength to Love* (MLK)
- Watch documentaries: Selma, 13th, The Long Walk of Nelson Mandela

**7. Support Peacebuilding Organizations**:
- **Donate** to: Christian Peacemaker Teams, Pax Christi, Sojourners
- **Volunteer** for local conflict mediation programs

**8. Speak Up Against Hate**:
- **When you hear**: Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism
- **Respond gently but firmly**: "That doesn't reflect Jesus's love."

**9. Fast from Violence**:
- **Media fast**: One day/week—no violent movies, news, video games
- **Notice**: How does consuming violence affect your inner peace?

**10. Join or Form a Peace Group**:
- **Small group Bible study** on peace texts
- **Activists**: Join Moral Monday, Poor People's Campaign, Extinction Rebellion (Christian chapters)

</ActionableInsight>

## Conclusion: The Peacemaker's Cross

**"Blessed are the peacemakers"** is not a platitude for greeting cards. It's a **dangerous, costly calling**—the way of the cross.

**Why Peacemaking is Hard**:
1. **Enemies remain enemies**: Some won't reconcile (Romans 12:18: "**If possible, so far as it depends on you**, live peaceably")
2. **Power resists peace**: Those profiting from conflict (war industry, oppressive systems) will fight peacemakers
3. **Violence is seductive**: Quick, satisfying, gives illusion of control—nonviolence requires patience, faith

**Why Peacemaking is Worth It**:
1. **You become like God**: "**Children of God**"—family resemblance unmistakable
2. **You build God's kingdom**: Every act of reconciliation manifests God's reign on Earth
3. **You save lives**: Violence destroys; peacemaking heals, restores, redeems
4. **You find true blessedness** (*makarios*)—deep joy, spiritual flourishing

**The Peacemaker's Promise**:

Not that life will be easy. Not that everyone will like you. Not that you'll always succeed.

But: **You will be called children of God.**

**And that's enough.**

**Prayer of St. Francis** (Traditional):

> Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
> Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
> Where there is injury, pardon;
> Where there is doubt, faith;
> Where there is despair, hope;
> Where there is darkness, light;
> Where there is sadness, joy.
>
> O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
> To be consoled as to console;
> To be understood as to understand;
> To be loved as to love.
>
> For it is in giving that we receive;
> It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
> And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

**Amen.**
