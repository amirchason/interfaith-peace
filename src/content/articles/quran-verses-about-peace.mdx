## Part I: Allah as As-Salaam — Peace as Divine Attribute

### 1. Surah 59:23 — God's Name is "The Peace" ⭐ FOUNDATIONAL

**Arabic:**
> هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ **السَّلَامُ** الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ

**Transliteration:**
*Huwa Allāhu alladhī lā ilāha illā huwa, al-Maliku al-Quddūsu **as-Salāmu** al-Mu'minu al-Muhayminu al-'Azīzu al-Jabbāru al-Mutakabbir. Subḥāna Allāhi 'ammā yushrikūn*

**Translation:**
"He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, **the Perfection (As-Salaam)**, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."

**Context:**

Surah Al-Hashr (59) describes the expulsion of Banu Nadir (a Jewish tribe that violated treaty with Muslims in Medina). The surah ends with Allah's 99 Names, including **As-Salaam**.

**Meaning of As-Salaam:**

***As-Salaam*** (السَّلَام) as divine name means:
1. **The Source of Peace**: All peace emanates from Allah
2. **The Perfect One**: Free from all defects, complete
3. **The Safe/Secure**: Provides safety to believers
4. **The Giver of Peace**: Bestows inner tranquility and outer security

**Imam Al-Ghazali** (*Al-Maqsad al-Asna*):
"As-Salaam is the One who is safe from every imperfection and free from every defect. He grants peace to His servants by protecting them from His punishment, guiding them to His paradise, and purifying them from evil traits."

**Practical Application:**

When Muslims recite this name in dhikr (remembrance), they seek:
- **Inner peace**: Freedom from anxiety, anger, despair
- **Outer peace**: Safety from harm, security in community
- **Spiritual peace**: Reconciliation with Allah, forgiveness of sins

---

### 2. Surah 10:25 — Allah Calls to the Home of Peace

**Arabic:**
> وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ **دَارِ السَّلَامِ** وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ

**Transliteration:**
*Wallāhu yad'ū ilā **Dāri s-Salām**, wa-yahdī man yashā'u ilā ṣirāṭin mustaqīm*

**Translation:**
"And Allah invites to **the Home of Peace** (Paradise) and guides whom He wills to a straight path."

**Context:**

Surah Yunus (10) contrasts the fleeting pleasures of this world with the eternal peace of the Hereafter.

**Dar as-Salaam (دار السلام):**

This is one of the names of **Paradise** (Jannah). The Abode of Peace where:
- No conflict, hatred, or violence exists
- All grudges are removed from hearts (Quran 15:47)
- Perfect security and tranquility reign
- Believers greet each other with "Salaam" (14:23, 19:62, 36:58)

**Ibn Kathir (Tafsir):**
"The Home of Peace is Paradise, named thus because it is the abode of safety from all evils, misfortunes, and anxieties. Peace is its characteristic, and 'Salaam' is the greeting of its inhabitants."

**Implication:**

If Paradise is the ultimate goal and it is defined by peace, then **striving for peace in this world is preparation for the Hereafter**. Violence, hatred, and conflict contradict the very nature of the Islamic ultimate destination.

## Part II: Salaam as Islamic Greeting

### 3. Surah 6:54 — The Greeting of Believers

**Arabic:**
> وَإِذَا جَاءَكَ الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا فَقُلْ **سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ** ۖ كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ

**Transliteration:**
*Wa-idhā jā'aka alladhīna yu'minūna bi-āyātinā fa-qul **salāmun 'alaykum**, kataba rabbukum 'alā nafsihi ar-raḥmah*

**Translation:**
"And when those who believe in Our verses come to you, say, '**Peace be upon you (Salaamun alaikum)**.' Your Lord has decreed upon Himself mercy."

**Context:**

This verse was revealed when poor Muslims (slaves, marginalized people) came to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and some wealthy Muslims looked down on them. Allah commands the Prophet to greet ALL believers with "Salaam," regardless of social status.

**Assalamu Alaikum:**

The Islamic greeting **"Assalamu alaikum"** (السلام عليكم) literally means:
- "**Peace be upon you**" (singular: *alayka*, plural: *alaykum*)
- Full form: "Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh" (Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah upon you)

**Prophetic Hadith** (Sahih Muslim 2163):
"You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I tell you something that, if you do it, you will love one another? **Spread salaam among yourselves.**"

**Why "Peace" as Greeting?**

1. **Affirms shared humanity**: Every encounter begins with wishing peace
2. **Dissolves hostility**: Hard to fight someone you've just greeted with peace
3. **Remembers Allah**: "Salaam" is Allah's name; using it invokes His presence
4. **Creates atmosphere of safety**: Assures the other person you mean no harm

**Scholarly Note (Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi):**
"The greeting of Salaam is not mere formality. It is a du'a (supplication)—a prayer that the other person be granted peace, safety, and well-being. Muslims should revive the practice of greeting even strangers with Salaam, as this spreads love and prevents enmity."

---

### 4. Surah 4:86 — Return Greeting with Better or Equal

**Arabic:**
> وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّوا بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَا أَوْ رُدُّوهَا

**Transliteration:**
*Wa-idhā ḥuyyītum bi-taḥiyyatin fa-ḥayyū bi-aḥsana minhā aw ruddūhā*

**Translation:**
"And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with one better than it or return it [in a like manner]."

**Application:**

- If someone says: "Assalamu alaikum" (Peace upon you)
- You should respond: "**Wa alaikum assalaam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh**" (And upon you be peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah) — **this is better**
- Or at minimum: "Wa alaikum assalaam" (And upon you be peace) — **this is equal**

**Etiquette of Salaam:**

1. **Initiate first**: Prophet ﷺ said, "The best among you is the one who initiates the salaam" (Abu Dawud 5197)
2. **Smile**: Smiling when saying salaam is Sunnah
3. **Audible**: Say it loud enough to be heard
4. **Respond promptly**: Delaying is makruh (disliked)
5. **To all**: Even those you don't know, even non-Muslims (some scholars allow "Peace be upon you" to People of the Book)

---

## Part III: Incline to Peace (Surah 8:61) — The Core Command

### 5. Surah 8:61 — If They Incline to Peace ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT VERSE

**Arabic:**
> وَإِن جَنَحُوا لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ

**Transliteration:**
*Wa-in janaḥū li-s-salmi fajnaḥ lahā wa-tawakkal 'alā Allāh, innahu huwa as-Samī'u al-'Alīm*

**Translation:**
"And **if they incline to peace, then you incline to it [also]** and rely upon Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing."

**Context:**

**Surah Al-Anfal (8)** was revealed after the Battle of Badr (624 CE), the first major military encounter between Muslims and Meccan polytheists. Verses 58-61 give rules of war:
- **Verse 58**: If a treaty is violated, announce termination openly (don't attack by surprise)
- **Verse 60**: Prepare military strength to **deter** enemies (not to initiate aggression)
- **Verse 61**: **If enemies offer peace, ACCEPT IT**—even if you suspect deception (leave judgment to Allah)

**Scholarly Consensus:**

**Ibn Kathir:**
"This verse is one of the clearest proofs that Islam prioritizes peace over war. When the enemy inclines to peace—even if Muslims have the upper hand militarily—they must accept it. The default is peace; war is exceptional and defensive only."

**Sheikh Muhammad Abduh (Egyptian reformer, 1849-1905):**
"Verse 8:61 abrogates (cancels) earlier harsher verses. The final message of Islam is: **Make peace when possible.** This verse was not abrogated and remains binding on all Muslims."

**Modern Application:**

- **Ceasefire agreements**: When enemies seek ceasefire, Muslims must honor it
- **Peace treaties**: Islam requires Muslims to uphold treaties (even if inconvenient)
- **Diplomatic resolution**: Preferred over military conflict

**Dr. Tariq Ramadan:**
"In our time, this verse should guide Muslim leaders to exhaust all diplomatic options before military action. The 'inclination to peace' could be a UN resolution, mediation offer, or bilateral negotiation. Islam demands we seize these opportunities."

---

### 6. Surah 8:56-58 — Uphold Treaties; Don't Betray

**Arabic (8:58):**
> وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَاءٍ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْخَائِنِينَ

**Translation:**
"And if you fear from a people betrayal, **throw [their treaty] back to them, [putting you] on equal terms.** Indeed, Allah does not like traitors."

**Meaning:**

- If allies are about to betray treaty, **publicly announce treaty termination** (don't surprise-attack)
- **"Putting you on equal terms"**: Both sides now know there's no treaty; fight honorably if needed
- **Never betray first**: "Allah does not like traitors"—Muslims prohibited from initiating treachery

**Prophetic Example:**

**Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE):** Prophet Muhammad ﷺ signed 10-year peace treaty with Meccans, even though terms seemed unfavorable. When Meccans violated it (by attacking Muslim allies), Prophet gave them ultimatum: honor treaty or it's void. When they broke it definitively, Muslims marched on Mecca—but offered amnesty, resulting in **peaceful conquest** with no bloodshed.

**Lesson:** **Peace agreements are sacred in Islam**, even when strategically disadvantageous.

---

## Part IV: Reconciliation Between Believers

### 7. Surah 49:9-10 — Make Peace Between Believers ⭐ COMMUNITY PEACE

**Arabic:**
> وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا **فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا** ۖ فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ **فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي** حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن فَاءَتْ **فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ** وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ ۝ **إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ** ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ

**Translation:**
"And if two factions among the believers should fight, **then make settlement between them.** But if one of them oppresses the other, **then fight against the one that oppresses** until it returns to the ordinance of Allah. And if it returns, **then make settlement between them in justice** and act justly. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. **The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers.** And fear Allah that you may receive mercy."

**Context:**

Surah Al-Hujurat (49) gives social ethics for Muslim community. This verse addresses **internal Muslim conflicts**.

**Three-Step Process:**

| **Stage** | **Action** | **Goal** |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **1. Mediation** | "Make settlement between them" | Negotiate peaceful resolution |
| **2. Intervention** (if needed) | "Fight the one that oppresses" | Stop aggressor, restore justice |
| **3. Just Peace** | "Make settlement in justice" | Fair resolution, no victor's peace |

**Key Principles:**

1. **Brothers fighting is still brotherhood**: "The believers are but brothers"—even in conflict, bond remains
2. **Third-party mediation required**: Community must intervene, not let conflict fester
3. **Justice is non-negotiable**: Peace without justice is unsustainable
4. **Force only against oppressor**: Not neutral—side with victim, stop aggressor
5. **Goal is reconciliation, not punishment**: Once aggressor stops, make peace immediately

**Historical Example:**

**Battle of the Camel (656 CE):** After Caliph Uthman's assassination, conflict erupted between Caliph Ali and Aisha (Prophet's widow). Many companions cited this verse, urging reconciliation. Though battle occurred (tragic), both sides sought peace afterward, and no one was declared "non-Muslim" despite fighting.

**Modern Application:**

- **Sectarian conflicts** (Sunni-Shia, etc.): Scholars must mediate based on this verse
- **Mosque disputes**: Community leaders should use this model (mediate, intervene if needed, restore justice)
- **Family feuds**: Same principle applies at smaller scale

---

### 8. Surah 4:128 — Reconciliation is Better

**Arabic:**
> وَإِنِ امْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِن بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزًا أَوْ إِعْرَاضًا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَن **يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحًا** ۚ **وَالصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ**

**Translation:**
"And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if **they make terms of settlement between them**—**and settlement is best**."

**Context:**

This verse addresses **marital conflict**, but the principle—**"settlement is best"** (والصلح خير)—is universal.

**Meaning:**

- **Sulh** (صلح): Reconciliation, settlement, making peace
- **Khayr** (خير): Better, good, preferable

**Even in difficult marriages** (where husband is neglectful or considering divorce), **attempting reconciliation is better than immediate separation**.

**Application Beyond Marriage:**

This phrase (**"And settlement is best"**) is quoted in Islamic jurisprudence as a **general principle**:
- Business disputes: Settle out of court before litigation
- Neighbor disputes: Mediate before escalating
- International conflicts: Negotiate before war

**Prophetic Hadith** (Sahih Bukhari 2692):
"**Reconciliation is permissible among Muslims**, except reconciliation that makes lawful what is forbidden or forbids what is lawful."

## Part V: Repel Evil with Good

### 9. Surah 41:34-35 — Repel with What is Better ⭐ REVOLUTIONARY ETHIC

**Arabic:**
> وَلَا تَسْتَوِي الْحَسَنَةُ وَلَا السَّيِّئَةُ ۚ **ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ** فَإِذَا الَّذِي بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِيٌّ حَمِيمٌ ۝ وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ

**Transliteration:**
*Wa-lā tastawī al-ḥasanatu wa-lā as-sayyi'ah. **Idfa' bi-allatī hiya aḥsan**, fa-idhā alladhī baynaka wa-baynahu 'adāwatun ka-annahu waliyyun ḥamīm. Wa-mā yulaqqāhā illā alladhīna ṣabarū, wa-mā yulaqqāhā illā dhū ḥaẓẓin 'aẓīm*

**Translation:**
"And not equal are the good deed and the bad. **Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better;** and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good]."

**Context:**

Surah Fussilat (41) gives ethical guidance for dealing with opponents (polytheists mocking Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and Muslims).

**Meaning:**

- **"Repel with what is better"**: When someone harms you, respond with **better conduct**, not equal retaliation
- **"Enmity becomes friendship"**: This approach **transforms enemies into friends**
- **Requires patience**: Only those with *sabr* (patience, perseverance) can do this
- **Great reward**: "One having a great portion of good"—immense spiritual rank

**Examples of "Repelling with Better":**

| **Evil Done to You** | **Equal Response** | **Better Response** |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Insulted | Insult back | Respond with kindness, ignore, or teach |
| Cheated in business | Seek revenge | Forgive, correct gently |
| Backbiting | Backbite them | Defend them in their absence |
| Physical harm (minor) | Retaliate | Forgive, help them understand |

**Prophetic Example:**

**Taif Incident (619 CE):** Prophet Muhammad ﷺ went to city of Taif to preach Islam. Residents rejected him violently—throwing stones, mocking, chasing him out bloodied. Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) offered to destroy the city by crushing it between two mountains. Prophet's response: **"No. I hope that Allah will bring forth from their descendants people who will worship Allah alone."** (Sahih Bukhari 3231)

**This is 41:34-35 in action**: Repelling violent rejection with **hope and prayer** for their descendants.

**Dr. Ingrid Mattson:**
"This verse is Islam's answer to 'love your enemies' (Matthew 5:44). While the phrasing differs, the ethic is the same: **break the cycle of retaliation through superior moral conduct.**"

---

### 10. Surah 23:96 — Repel Evil with Best

**Arabic:**
> **ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ** ۚ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ

**Translation:**
"**Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil.** We are most knowing of what they describe."

**Additional Context:**

Same command as 41:34, reinforcing its importance. Prophet instructed to respond to mockery with:
- **Patience** (not anger)
- **Good character** (not insults)
- **Preaching truth** (not vengeance)

---

## Part VI: Forgiveness and Mercy

### 11. Surah 42:40-43 — Forgiveness is Better Than Revenge

**Arabic:**
> وَجَزَاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا ۖ **فَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ** ۚ إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الظَّالِمِينَ ۝ وَلَمَنِ انتَصَرَ بَعْدَ ظُلْمِهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَا عَلَيْهِم مِّن سَبِيلٍ ۝ إِنَّمَا السَّبِيلُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَظْلِمُونَ النَّاسَ وَيَبْغُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ ۝ **وَلَمَن صَبَرَ وَغَفَرَ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ لَمِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ**

**Translation:**
"And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, **but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation—his reward is [due] from Allah.** Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers. And whoever avenges himself after having been wronged—those have not upon them any cause [for blame]. The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment. **And whoever is patient and forgives—indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.**"

**Three Options When Wronged:**

| **Option** | **Quranic View** | **Reward** |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **1. Proportional revenge** | Permissible ("evil for evil like it") | Permissible, but no special reward |
| **2. Forgive & reconcile** | **Recommended** | **Reward from Allah** |
| **3. Patience & forgive** | **Best** | **"Matters of determination" (highest spiritual rank)** |

**Key Insights:**

1. **Revenge is allowed**: Islam doesn't demand you be a doormat—self-defense and proportional justice are rights
2. **But forgiveness is better**: Higher moral ground, greater spiritual reward
3. **Forgiveness ≠ Injustice**: "He does not like wrongdoers"—forgiveness must not enable oppression; sometimes justice required
4. **Patience required**: "Whoever is patient and forgives"—this is not weakness but strength

**When to Forgive vs. Seek Justice:**

- **Personal offenses**: Forgiveness encouraged (insults, minor harms, relational conflicts)
- **Systemic oppression**: Justice required (tyranny, genocide, corruption)—can't "forgive" Hitler

**Prophetic Example:**

**Conquest of Mecca (630 CE):** After 20+ years of persecution, torture, boycott, assassination attempts by Meccans, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ returned with 10,000 troops. He had power to exact revenge. Instead, he declared: **"There is no blame on you today. Go, you are free."** (Similar to Joseph's words to his brothers in Quran 12:92)

---

### 12. Surah 3:134 — Those Who Restrain Anger and Pardon

**Arabic:**
> الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِي السَّرَّاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ **وَالْكَاظِمِينَ الْغَيْظَ وَالْعَافِينَ عَنِ النَّاسِ** ۗ وَاللَّهُ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ

**Translation:**
"Who spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and **who restrain anger and who pardon the people**—and Allah loves the doers of good."

**Context:**

Description of *Al-Muttaqun* (the righteous). Three qualities listed:
1. **Generosity** (give in prosperity and hardship)
2. **Anger control** (restrain rage even when provoked)
3. **Forgiveness** (pardon those who wrong you)

**"Restrain Anger" (الكاظمين الغيظ):**

***Kadhimin al-ghayz*** = Those who **swallow anger**, suppress rage

**Prophetic Hadith** (Sahih Bukhari 6114):
"The strong person is not the one who can overpower others physically. Rather, **the strong person is the one who controls himself when angry.**"

**"Pardon the People" (والعافين عن الناس):**

***Al-'afin 'an an-nas*** = Those who **forgive people**

**Hadith** (Sahih Muslim 2588):
"**Charity does not decrease wealth.** No one forgives another except that Allah increases his honor. And no one humbles himself for the sake of Allah except that Allah raises his status."

---

## Part VII: Justice as Foundation of Peace

### 13. Surah 4:135 — Stand Firmly for Justice

**Arabic:**
> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا **كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ بِالْقِسْطِ** شُهَدَاءَ لِلَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوِ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ

**Translation:**
"O you who have believed, **be persistently standing firm in justice**, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives."

**Justice (*Qist*, قسط):**

- **No peace without justice**: Oppression creates resentment, resentment breeds violence
- **Even against yourself**: Self-accountability (admit your own wrongs)
- **Even against family**: Love doesn't excuse injustice

---

### 14. Surah 5:8 — Be Just, Even to Enemies

**Arabic:**
> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ **وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا** ۚ **اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ**

**Translation:**
"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and **do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness.**"

**Revolutionary Principle:**

**Even if you hate your enemies, you must be fair to them.**

- No collective punishment
- No false accusations
- No dehumanization
- **Justice transcends tribal loyalty**

**Relevance Today:**

- Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Both sides must be judged by same standards
- War crimes: Can't excuse "our side," condemn "their side"
- Immigration: Refugees deserve due process even if you fear them

## Part VIII: Prohibited Acts That Destroy Peace

### 15. Surah 5:32 — Killing One Person = Killing All Humanity ⭐ SANCTITY OF LIFE

**Arabic:**
> مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ **مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا**

**Translation:**
"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that **whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land—it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one—it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.**"

**Context:**

Refers to Cain and Abel story (Quran 5:27-31). After Cain murdered Abel, Allah revealed this law.

**Two Exceptions to "Don't Kill":**

1. **"Unless for a soul"** (*bi-ghayri nafsin*): Qisas (retribution) for murder—judicial execution after due process
2. **"Or corruption in the land"** (*fasad fi al-ard*): Scholars debate meaning:
   - Some: Waging war against state (treason, terrorism)
   - Others: Rape, highway robbery (serious violent crimes)
   - **NOT** apostasy, blasphemy (these don't meet "corruption" threshold per many modern scholars)

**Key Point:**

**Killing ONE innocent person = killing ALL humanity.** Why?
- Destroys sacredness of life principle
- If murder is normalized, civilization collapses
- Every human has equal value (no "lesser people")

**Counter-Terrorism Implications:**

ISIS, Al-Qaeda, etc. violate Quran 5:32 by:
- Killing innocents (civilians, aid workers, journalists)
- Targeting based on religion/ethnicity
- Claiming to serve Islam while committing mass murder

**Grand Mufti of Egypt** (after ISIS attacks):
"They cite Quran 9:5 ('kill the polytheists') while ignoring Quran 5:32 ('killing one is killing all'). This is deception. The Quran must be read as a whole, and the **sanctity of life** is the overarching principle."

### 16. Surah 2:190 — Fight Only Those Who Fight You; Don't Transgress

**Arabic:**
> **وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا** ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ

**Translation:**
"**Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress.** Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors."

**Rules of War:**

1. **Defensive only**: "Those who fight you"—not civilians, not bystanders
2. **Don't transgress**: No torture, mutilation, rape, targeting non-combatants, destroying crops/water sources, killing animals unnecessarily

**Prophetic Rules** (compiled from Sahih Hadith):

When sending armies, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ commanded:
- ❌ Don't kill women
- ❌ Don't kill children
- ❌ Don't kill elderly
- ❌ Don't kill monks/priests in monasteries
- ❌ Don't cut down trees
- ❌ Don't poison water
- ❌ Don't burn crops
- ❌ Don't mutilate bodies
- ✅ Give warning before attack (if possible)
- ✅ Accept surrender
- ✅ Treat prisoners humanely

**Modern Geneva Conventions echo these 1,400-year-old Islamic rules.**

### 17. Surah 6:151 — Do Not Kill (Sixth Commandment Parallel)

**Arabic:**
> قُلْ تَعَالَوْا أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ... **وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ**

**Translation:**
"Say, 'Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you... **and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right.**'"

**This is part of Quranic "Ten Commandments"** (6:151-153), paralleling Biblical Decalogue:
1. No shirk (associating partners with Allah)
2. Honor parents
3. Don't kill your children (out of poverty)
4. Avoid immorality
5. **Don't kill unjustly**
6. Don't take orphan's wealth
7. Be just in measuring/weighing
8. Speak justly
9. Fulfill covenant with Allah
10. Follow straight path

## Part IX: Patience and Restraint

### 18. Surah 16:126-127 — If You Retaliate, Do So Proportionally; But Patience is Better

**Arabic:**
> وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُم بِهِ ۖ **وَلَئِن صَبَرْتُمْ لَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لِّلصَّابِرِينَ** ۝ **وَاصْبِرْ وَمَا صَبْرُكَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ** ۚ وَلَا تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا تَكُ فِي ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ

**Translation:**
"And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed. **But if you are patient—it is better for those who are patient. And be patient, [O Muhammad], and your patience is not but through Allah.** And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire."

**Three Levels:**

1. **Proportional retaliation** (allowed, but not ideal)
2. **Patience** (better, recommended)
3. **Patience through Allah** (best, relying on God not human willpower)

**Context:**

Revealed after Battle of Uhud (625 CE), where Muslims were defeated and 70 companions martyred (including Prophet's uncle Hamzah, who was mutilated). Prophet was tempted to seek harsh revenge. This verse came: **Patience is better.**

### 19. Surah 25:63 — When Addressed Ignorantly, Say "Peace"

**Arabic:**
> وَعِبَادُ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الَّذِينَ يَمْشُونَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ هَوْنًا **وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الْجَاهِلُونَ قَالُوا سَلَامًا**

**Translation:**
"And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth in humility, and **when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace.**"

**"Say Peace" (قالوا سلاما):**

Not "fight back," not "insult back"—**say "Salam" (peace).**

**Modern Application:**

- Online trolls: Don't engage in flame wars; respond with dignity or disengage
- Family arguments: De-escalate with calm words
- Interfaith debates: When opponents are rude, maintain composure

## Part X: Paradise as Ultimate Peace

### 20. Surah 14:23 — Greeting in Paradise: "Peace"

**Arabic:**
> وَأُدْخِلَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ **تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَامٌ**

**Translation:**
"And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein by permission of their Lord; **their greeting therein will be, 'Peace!'**"

**Paradise Described as Peace:**

- **No conflict** (7:43: "We have removed all ill feeling from their hearts")
- **No fear, no grief** (2:62, 2:112, 2:262, 2:274, etc.)
- **Only** ***salaam*** (19:62, 36:58)

## Conclusion: The Quran's Overwhelming Message is Peace

**Summary:**

- **140+ mentions** of peace root (S-L-M)
- **Allah is As-Salaam** (The Source of Peace)
- **Paradise is Dar as-Salaam** (Home of Peace)
- **Greeting is Salaam** (Peace be upon you)
- **Command to incline to peace** (8:61)
- **Reconciliation commanded** (49:9-10)
- **Repel evil with good** (41:34)
- **Forgiveness better than revenge** (42:40)
- **Sanctity of life** (5:32)
- **Justice required** (4:135, 5:8)
- **Patience over retaliation** (16:126-127)

**The 25 "warfare verses"** (often cited by critics) must be read in context:
- **All defensive** (responding to aggression)
- **Specific historical circumstances** (Battle of Badr, Uhud, Trench, etc.)
- **Overridden by peace verses** when enemies seek peace (8:61)

**Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl** (UCLA Islamic Studies):
"The Quran's dominant paradigm is peace. War is permitted only as a last resort, under strict conditions, and must end the moment enemies seek peace. Any interpretation that presents Islam as inherently violent ignores 95% of the Quranic text."

**A Prayer for Peace:**

> *"O Allah, As-Salaam (The Source of Peace): Grant us inner peace through submission to You, outer peace in our communities, and global peace among all nations. Help us be peacemakers as You commanded: 'Make peace between believers' (49:10). Guide us to repel evil with good (41:34), forgive when wronged (42:40), and always incline to peace when others seek it (8:61). May Your greeting—'Peace be upon you'—be not just our words, but our way of life. Ameen."*
